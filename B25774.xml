            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Good Fortune which has always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended me by Sea and Land, in my laſt Travels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Levant,</hi> incourages me to preſume, that that ſame Providence, which more
<pb facs="tcp:205900:4"/> eſpecially aſſigns certain <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's</hi> to watch over the ſafety of ſuch Perſons, which it culls out for the Execution of the greateſt Enterpriſes, caſt an Eye upon me, from the very Moment that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>London,</hi> with a Reſolution to find your Lordſhip out, in whatever part of the World you were. That Providence doubtleſs it was, which having ſnatch'd me from the gaping Jaws of Dragons in <hi>France,</hi> and deliver'd me from ſeveral dangers and hazards which I ran both upon the one and the other Sea, diverted alſo
<pb facs="tcp:205900:4"/> from my Heart the Sharp pointed Dagger of a <hi>Megera,</hi> which Hell it ſelf had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited up to overwhelm me at <hi>Venice:</hi> This Providence it was that ſtaid a ſmall Veſſel at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> for ſeven Months together, till the day that I arriv'd to embark my ſelf for <hi>Smyrna,</hi> &amp; to be there before your Lordſhip was to depart, in purſuance of other Voyages quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Advantage of your Affairs, and which I could never diſcover. At length being happily return'd home under the Conduct of your ſucceſsful Patronage, after
<pb facs="tcp:205900:5"/> I had travell'd Six thouſand nine hundred Miles by Sea or by Land in four Months time, I flatter'd my ſelf, that in Dedicating to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip this little Piece, which departs from my Study upon a Voyage to the Republick of the Curious, it might find the ſame Good Fortune as the Author of it. Tho' indeed a ſtronger Reaſon oblig'd me to procure it this Honour; that is to ſay, the Grandeur of a Name which has preſerv'd it ſelf untar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh d in the Nobility of your Family for many Ages, even till this very day in
<pb facs="tcp:205900:5"/> your own Illuſtrious Perſon. For you are deſcended from that Great <hi>Hero,</hi> who aſſiſted <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> to lay the Foundations of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, which the Sword of your Anceſtors has ever ſince upheld with the hazard of their Lives. Witneſs that Thunder-bolt of War, the Deceaſed Earl your Father, who for having taken up Arms in the defence of the King his Maſter, had loſt his Head, had not the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of Heaven cruſht the Tyrant who had condemn'd him by the means of a ſmall number of Judges and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:205900:6"/> Men, that then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd no other Law than Abſolute Power. And your Lordſhip, the true Off-ſpring of ſo many Hero's, tracing their Glorious Examples, declar'd your ſelf againſt your beſt Friend, ſo ſoon as he appear'd to be an Enemy to the King his Father, whoſe Arms your Proweſs caus'd to be redoubted, both in <hi>Flanders</hi> and wherever elſe the Honour of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands carry'd you. I could ſay much more, but that your Modeſty obliges me to ſilence. But to what purpoſe ſhould I be multiplying
<pb facs="tcp:205900:6"/> words, when your own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themſelves ſufficiently Proclaim the reſt, as well as your Perſon, which alone attracts the Affection and Eſteem of all that have the advantage to know thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Qualities with which God has endow'd your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and of which I wiſh your Lordſhip a happy and long Enjoyment.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Had written in my time ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Volumes upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Subjects, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I threw into the Fire; as well for that they diſlik'd me (for I am a very ſevere Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of my own works,) as for that I did not think them proper for the Genius of the Age, more inclin'd to trifles than to ſerious things. Nevertheleſs I was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to the Memory of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, not ſo much for any
<pb facs="tcp:205900:8"/> Eſteem which I had of them, but that I might leave my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſettl'd in a Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try the Conſolation of knowing whence they came, and by what Accident they happen'd to be born. Afterwards underſtanding by the Converſation which I had had with the Bookſellers, that Books of Travels were agreeable to the Palates of moſt Readers, the Inclination which I have had all my life to be ſerviceable to Mankind, made me reſolve to publiſh this ſmall Part of mine, at leaſt to give ſome few hours Divertiſement to the Publick by reading them; with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that if this ſmall Eſſay
<pb facs="tcp:205900:8"/> find acceptance, they ſhall have the whole Journal entire. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion was begun in <hi>French</hi> the laſt year; at what time finding my ſelf oblig'd to return into the <hi>Levant,</hi> upon the occaſion which I have hinted in the preceding Epiſtle, I deſir'd the Printer to ſtop his Preſs till my return, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I deſir'd to overſee it. In the mean time he had caus'd my Copy to be Tranſlated into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> which I view'd and found faithfully done. After which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reſtor'd him his Tranſlation to do what he pleas'd with it, he deſir'd me to anſwer ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which had been made in my abſence.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:205900:9"/>
            <p>In the firſt Place they will hardly believe the Shipwrack which I ſuffered in my Third year, nor the manner how I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped. Nevertheleſs there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more certain than what I have ſaid of it: beſides other Circumſtances, which I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted which would ſeem yet more incredible. All the City of <hi>Lyons,</hi> which is the Place of my Nativity, was at that time fully poſſeſs'd of it; I was there lookt upon as another <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Neither am I ſo old, but that there are ſtill Perſons alive that can teſtifie the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> They will have <hi>Heliopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> to have been in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:205900:9"/> confeſs it; but that is not the <hi>Heliopolis</hi> I ſpeak of. But as there are at this time ſeveral Cities of the ſame name; as <hi>Frankfort</hi> upon the <hi>Maine, Frankfort</hi> upon the <hi>Oder; Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> upon the <hi>Saone,</hi> and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on le Saulnier;</hi> or <hi>Lyons</hi> where the Saltpits are, beſides <hi>Leiden</hi> which the <hi>Latins</hi> call <hi>Lugdunum</hi> alſo: <hi>Chalon</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Saone,</hi> and <hi>Chalons</hi> upon the <hi>Marne; Valence</hi> in the <hi>Dauphinate,</hi> and <hi>Valence</hi> in <hi>Spain:</hi> Why muſt it be deny'd, but that beſides <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> there may be that other of which I have given the Relation in <hi>Tartary.</hi> They
<pb facs="tcp:205900:10"/> who never ſaw more than their own Village, never imagin that Steeples are of any other faſhion than their own. <hi>Lactantius</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> laught at thoſe who by the dictates of ſound ſence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd there were <hi>Antipodes.</hi> And a <hi>German</hi> Biſhop was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd for a Heretick before Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> upon the ſame ſcore. And if <hi>Columbus</hi> had not diſcover'd the way where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers follow'd him, we ſhould have had enow pitiful Schollars that would have maintain'd there was never any ſuch thing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once in a Coach with an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Lady, underſtanding that I was a <hi>French</hi> Man, ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:205900:10"/> would not believe that they ſpoke in <hi>France</hi> any other Language than hers, which ſhe thought to be the Language of the whole World. Good God! how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People are there, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving themſelves to be very witty, are altogether like this Woman? If not in this very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, yet in ſeveral other things. We have taken for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles what the Poets or the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients have told us of the firſt Inhabitants of the World. That they liv'd after the manner of Beaſts, without Commonwealths, without Laws, naked, and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Acorns, and what the Earth produc'd, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:205900:11"/> preparation than that of Nature. Yet they who return from <hi>America,</hi> tell us that they meet with ſuch People there at this day, and that that part of the World is ſtill in its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. Nay though our own Hemiſphear be ſo Polite, yet there are ſome Cantons diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, where the Men have only the outward ſhape of Men: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Savage, which, as Monſieur <hi>Sloskoski</hi> a Canon of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> told me at <hi>Padua,</hi> he ſaw in his own Country, and which had been brought from the Mountains that ſeparate <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from <hi>Hungary.</hi> He was all over Hair, ſpoke not at all,

<pb facs="tcp:205900:12"/> Now becauſe there was not any Author, who had inform'd the <hi>Polonians</hi> that there were Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages ſo near them, had they any reaſon to give the Lye to thoſe, who having travell'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either out of Curioſity, or by accident, ſhould have aſſur'd them that it was ſo, unleſs they had brought one of thoſe Savages along with them? which howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was more eaſie for them to do than to bring a <hi>Heliopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi> into <hi>Europe.</hi> For of things which we do not ſee, we know nothing but by the Report of others.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:205900:16"/> In ſhort, his Characters have ſuch a Correſpondence with thoſe of the Deity, that were it not for that Revelation which informs us to the contrary, we could not be blam'd for adoring him as the God of this ſubluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry World. The Earth, which ſeems to undergo a kind of Death at his departure, ſeems to riſe again at his return; while the Plants ſending forth their Flowers and Leaves, recloath her with their gayeſt Ornaments. The Birds renew their Amours; the very Inſects propagate; the more perfect Animals reſume new vigor to engender their like: And, in a word, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mother of all things grows young again, when he has fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his Southern Retrograda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and comes back to us.

For the vaſt extent of his Beams renders him preſent over all the Univerſe, of which he penetrates the deep Abyſſes, there to produce Gold, Diamonds and Pearls. He is the inexhauſtible Fountain of that heat which enlivens us, and our real Fellow-parent in the Generation of our Children, if we may give credit to <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> He is lovely for his Beauty, to be adored for his Power, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable for his Effects, formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable

Their Form of Government is Ariſtocratical, under Laws that ſeem to have been borrowed from <hi>Plato</hi>'s Commonwealth, or elſe from the primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as injoying all things in common, tho' it be not really ſo, as you ſhall ſee in reading theſe Travels, which I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to undertake upon the following occaſion.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:205900:18"/>
            <p>In the third year of my Age, and the year of our Lord 1636. I was ſent by my Parents from a Country-houſe upon the <hi>Saone</hi> two Leagues above <hi>Lyons,</hi> with my Governeſs in a Boat, which through the careleſsneſs of the Maſter, was overſet by another larger Veſſel that was tow'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſame River. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I heard the confuſed noiſe of Shrieks and crying-out, <hi>We are loſt, we are loſt;</hi> I ask'd what was the matter? they made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That they believed me to be the Cauſe of their diſaſter, while the Boat-men ſtood ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing to ſee me play in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. At length I loſt my ſenſes, I know not how. But no ſooner recovering my ſelf, I ſaw a Lady floating upon the Water, that with a lamentable voice called
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:205900:19"/> me by name; whereupon I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to her and others whom I ſaw periſhing before my Eyes, to do as I did: For I fanſied my ſelf holding faſt by the Piles of a wooden-Bridge, believing certainly that I could not be drowned ſo long as I kept my hold. Methought alſo that ſome body went about to hinder me from ſaving my ſelf, by thruſting away my Head with a Pole, which made me call him Cruel. Being thus loſt a ſecond time, I remain'd ſenceleſs, till I found my ſelf in a Bed, where ſome People had laid me, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving me from the ſhoar about half a League lower, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving me to be a Bundle of Goods, came and fetch'd me out of the middle of the River, where they found me carried by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:205900:19"/> the Stream upon a Bavin of Vine-Twigs. About two hours after the Boat was ſunk, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were fourteen Perſons all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately drown'd. From that time forward, being at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of thoſe to whom I was beholding for my life, I rowl'd from School to School, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Greek, Latin, and Poetry, with whatever beſides the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Sciences contains, till I was fourteen years of age; at what time being fallen into the hands of a ſort of Perſons, who have the ſubtilty to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves into the ſimple Minds of Youth, and to make what impreſſion they pleaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I ſuffer'd my ſelf to be led by their perſwaſions to follow their Maxims. I remain'd in their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety travelling from City to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:205900:20"/> City, from Country to Country, till I was four and twenty years of Age; at what time finding my ſelf at <hi>Rome</hi> in full leiſure to examine the Sciences, which I thought I had acquir'd, I found by my ſelf, that I knew nothing becauſe I had been ill taught: Therefore I tranſlated my ſelf from the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> to the <hi>Portico,</hi> to the end I might give my ſelf wholly up to the Study of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, till the Reflections which I made upon the ſeveral Objects that preſented themſelves to my Senſes, furniſh'd me with other Principles, that made me apply my ſelf to the ſtudy of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Phyſick, with a greater ſatisfaction than before.</p>
            <p>During this leiſure of mine, I open'd my Eyes to obſerve the Cheats that had been put upon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:205900:20"/> me, and bethought my ſelf that it was my duty to abandon thoſe People, whoſe ill lead Lives gave the Lye ſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their Tenents. There ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving communicated my Deſign to <hi>Monthreſo,</hi> the honeſteſt and the moſt Learned among the whole Tribe, he not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd it, but deſir'd he might have the honour to accompany me in ſo laudable an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. With theſe Reſolutions we departed from the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire the Twentieth of <hi>January</hi> 1663. by St. <hi>John Lateran</hi>'s Gate, and arrive at <hi>Naples</hi> by the 25th. where after we had ſeen the Curioſities of <hi>Puzzuolo,</hi> and <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> tir'd with our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels through the Principal Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> we reſolv'd to ſee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:205900:21"/> the Varieties of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Territories of the World. Thereupon reſolving to go aboard the firſt Veſſel that ſet ſail for the <hi>Levant,</hi> we went to the Sea-ſide, where we met with <hi>Signor Hippolito,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the good Ship call'd the <hi>Hope;</hi> who underſtanding our deſign, made us an obliging Proffer of his Service, which we readily accepting, embark'd the fourth of <hi>February,</hi> with a Wind ſo favourable, that in a ſhort time we loſt ſight of the Land, which by Sickneſs laying in my Cabin I ſaw no more till we arriv'd at <hi>Porto Lione,</hi> where we again had a view of it the Fifteenth. Overjoy'd that I was ſo near a Place which was formerly the Manſion of all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Wiſdom, I ſoon forgot the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:205900:21"/> tireſome hardſhips of the Sea. So ſoon as I caſt my Eyes upon the ancient <hi>Pyraeum,</hi> ſo ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Time, that it does not preſerve ſo much as its Name, chang'd into that which it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries at preſent, by reaſon of the ill-ſhap'd figure of a Lyon. In the ſame Place we hir'd Poſt-Horſes to viſit <hi>Athens,</hi> diſtant from the Port about five Miles. So ſoon as I arriv'd there, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look for the rugged Ruins of that Famous Piece of Antiquity. Wherein I found great Aſſiſtance from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Learned <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> to whom I was recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Friends at <hi>Venice.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was my own Skill in the Greek unprofitable to me. For though the Vulgar Greek differs very little from that in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:205900:22"/> Schools, the Corruption of this is not ſo great, but that it may be underſtood, when it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken according to the Pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Country. Beſides that it is as common among Perſons of Quality, as Latin among the <hi>Polonians.</hi> Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they told me, that there is no other Greek to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly than that. In regard that what is call'd Vulgar Greek is a kind of Pedlars French, which differs according to the ſeveral Juriſdictions of the Country: that it was the ſame in the time of <hi>Demoſthenes;</hi> that then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the four Dialects moſt known, there were ſome other in uſe among the Vulgar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but that the Orators in their publick Pleadings made uſe of the common Speech,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:205900:22"/> which was underſtood by the ordinary ſort, although they did not ſpeak it; which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to me by the Letters of private Perſons written at that time, and which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found in the Ruins of old Walls. Their Books alſo were written in that ſort of Greek, which we call for that Reaſon <hi>Literal,</hi> and which is the very ſame that the Preachers at this day make uſe of in their Sermons. In a word that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is deem'd to write and ſpeak beſt among them, who comes neareſt the Language of the Ancient Authors; which is at this day the only Standard of the Language, as the <hi>Paragon</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Pariſian</hi> in <hi>France</hi> in reſpect of the other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where though it be not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:205900:23"/> ſpoken, yet it is underſtood by the meaner ſort. The Citadel or <hi>Acropolis</hi> ſeated upon a Rock commands the City, and is ſeen at Sea. Being not permitted to go in I could ſee no more than the outward ſide of it; but my Friend told me that there was a noble Piece of Antiquity, <hi>viz.</hi> the Temple of <hi>Diana.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever all that we could meet with of the Ancient Ornaments of that City, built many Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rome</hi> was, only certain ſmall Towers erected in honour of thoſe who had been Victors in the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, and ſome Portico's of ruin'd Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; among which there is one which reſembles that of <hi>Virile Fortune,</hi> which is now the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> St. <hi>Mary's</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Banks of <hi>Tiber,</hi> in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:205900:23"/> Fleſh-market. They ſhew'd me alſo a certain piece of carv'd Work, repreſenting <hi>Diana</hi> in her hunting Habit, attended in a Wood by her Nymphs. It was a wonderful Piece of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, and the Inſcription gave us to underſtand, that it was wrought by the hand of <hi>Phidias,</hi> having been digg'd, but a little before we came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, out of the Ruins of the <hi>Areopagus;</hi> which does not now ſtand within the compaſs of the City, that is now reduc'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a leſſer compaſs. They alſo ſhew'd me the place of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Altar Erected to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God. Several Statues are digg'd up out of the Earth every day, of which not one that I have ſeen comes near to thoſe of <hi>Italy.</hi> Thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:205900:24"/> amaz'd to ſee ſo few Signs of its ancient Splendor, they made me anſwer, that I might ſee them in other Places, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the War had tranſplanted them, or elſe Barter in Traffick. Indeed there was one Piece which I ſaw the laſt time I was at <hi>Venice,</hi> in the Houſe of <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Michele Peruli,</hi> an <hi>Athenian</hi> Merchant, which had been ſent him as a Preſent, repreſenting in <hi>Baſs Relief,</hi> a young man ſtark naked, holding a<note n="*" place="margin">Or elſe a Horn-Owlet, for the word ſignifies the ſame.</note> Jack-daw in his Right hand. The bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om of the Sculpture was adorn'd with a Palm-tree, upon the Trunk of which a certain kind of <hi>Beetle</hi> was engrav'd in a creeping Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. The Corniſh comes forth as far as the Statue, and is raiſed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:205900:24"/> by two borders, between which at the Top theſe words are to be read in Greek Letters, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſome will therefore have to be the Son of the Great <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> The Piece is good from the Belly downward; but the Head is not very extraordinary, and the left hand is broke off. Every Body knows that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Venus</hi> which formerly ſtood upon <hi>Mount Pincius</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and is now to be ſeen in the Galleries of <hi>Florence,</hi> leave being given to the Grand Duke by the preſent Pope to remove it thither, was the Work of an <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> whoſe name is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grav'd at the bottom of the Statue, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Kleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:205900:25"/> the Son of Apollodorus an Athenian made this.</hi> A favour which the Dukes Predeceſſors could ne'er obtain, though from Popes of the ſame Family. So cautious they were of parting with any of the Ornaments of their City; whereas the preſent Pope ſuffers them to be daily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, notwithſtanding all the grumbling of the <hi>Romans.</hi> So that all that remains at this day of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Antiquity is their Olive Trees and their Wit. Theſe Olive Trees en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs it round, and are the chief Revenue of the <hi>Athenians.</hi> Their other Fruits are very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and it may be the beſt in the World. But as for the Inhabitants they are no leſs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Witty and Ingenious than ever; ſo that if they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:205900:25"/> were but well manur'd by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, they would prove as Good Poets, Orators, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Statuaries or other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts whatever, as ever were known at the time when it flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd in its higheſt Splendour. The Turks have the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for them as the <hi>Romans</hi> had; who ſuffer them to live according to their own Laws, and to be govern'd by their own Magiſtrates, for the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> is contented only with ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither one of his Favourite Eunuchs, who receives the Duty impos'd, without farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf with their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; beſides that his Garriſon is very inconſiderable. The Biſhop is Judge of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between the Dioceſans, who generally ſubmit to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:205900:26"/> for fear of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Cenſures. They trade into <hi>Italy</hi> with their Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for which they receive in exchange Cloth, and all manner of Iron Tools. Their Women are handſome, and richly clad in their Garments embroider'd with Gold down to their very Shooes, which their Husbands, though poor, willingly let them have, for fear of a greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. The Citizens of Quality wear a long black robe with ſhort Sleeves; but their Prieſts are habited much like the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sleeve is not gathered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Pleats: In the City they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wear upon their Heads a round Cap; but in the Country a flat Hat; which they call an <hi>Iſchiodon,</hi> becauſe it covers them
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:205900:26"/> from the Sun; their Beds are Quilts laid down on the Sopſa, but ſome of them are furniſh'd after our own faſhion.</p>
            <p>They believe the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament; though the moſt Learned among them have acknowledg'd to me, that the Fathers never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> meant. They ſay moreover that Chriſt is not there preſent in that manner which the <hi>Latins</hi> hold, when the Prieſt pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces theſe Words, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>This is my Body;</hi> which they affirm to be purely Hiſtorical, but by virtue of the Prayer when he ſays, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Make this Bread the worthy Body of Chriſt.</hi> I obſerv'd that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kneel'd before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:205900:27"/> but only bow'd with their Shoulders to the Bread, as well before as after Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Liturgy being ended, the Prieſt invites the People to the Communion, if no body come, he eats the remainder upon a Table which ſtands at the ſide of the North Door.</p>
            <p>As for the Sick, they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate of the Bread and Wine Conſecrated by the Biſhop upon <hi>Maundy Thurſday</hi> for the whole year. To which purpoſe they keep the Bread ſteep'd in the Wine, by the ſide of the Altar in a Cup-board without Light. I ask'd them, whither the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſo preſerv'd, did not putrifie; but they aſſur'd me, it did not.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops Miter is not cloven, but round, and all beſet
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:205900:27"/> with precious Stones. All the Biſhops believe themſelves to be equal as to the Function, but not as to the Sea, the Dignity of which exalts the one above the other, by virtue of an Inſtitution purely Humane, and not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
            <p>They never ſtay till they are ſick to receive the Sacrament of Extream Unction; but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it all every year in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Week, after this manner: Two Archbiſhops bleſs the Oil; afterwards the Archbiſhop of the Church being ſeated in his Chair, and five or ſix Prieſts in theirs, the People preſent themſelves to be anointed, firſt by the Prelate, who holding a Wax Candle in his hand, dips the Cotten in the holy Oil, and then anoints the Forhead,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:205900:28"/> the Face, and Palm of the Hand; after which the ſame Perſon goes to the other Prieſts who do the ſame. They pray for the dead, whoſe Souls they believe remain in this World in expectation of the General day of Judgment; not admitting any parcicular Judgment.</p>
            <p>They frequently perfume with Frankincenſe in their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which are very decent, and fill the Soul with a ſenſible Devotion. I ask'd them the reaſon why they made ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of their Perfumes; to which they anſwer'd, That it was to admoniſh the People to ſend up their Prayers with the Perfume, which aſcends toward Heaven. As to what remains, the Eaſtern Church glories in its Priority, which they aſſume
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:205900:28"/> to themſelves, and which is no more than Truth; neither do the <hi>Latins</hi> diſpute the Point of Elderſhip. That which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd me was this, that they ſhould preſerve themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tyranny of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> who neither by their oppreſſive Impoſitions, nor fair Promiſes, could ever oblige the Eaſtern Chriſtians to change the <hi>Goſpel</hi> for the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> To which purpoſe I will impart to the Reader two Remarkable Paſſages, that happen'd about ſix years ſince; the one at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> that befel a young man between ſeventeen and eighteen years of Age, whoſe Name was <hi>Anthony,</hi> Learned for his Age in the Turkiſh Language above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, belov'd by every one for his Excellent Qualities, even of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:205900:29"/> the Turks themſelves, who for that reaſon would fain have brought him over to the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> Religion. To which purpoſe they ſhew'd him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Note to read, wherein were written, in <hi>Arabian,</hi> theſe words, <hi>I believe in God, and in Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met his Apoſtle.</hi> So ſoon as he had read it, they ſaluted him as one of their Brethren, ſaying he was a Turk, as having made a Profeſſion of their Religion by reading that Note. He deny'd it; upon which they carried him before a Judge who condemn'd him. From thence they hal'd him to the Grand <hi>Viſier,</hi> who upon the Teſtimony of thoſe wicked People who had ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd him, condemn'd him alſo to make profeſſion of the Law, as being thereto oblig'd by his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:205900:29"/> reading. Upon his refuſal they carried him to Priſon, where for thirty days he endured moſt horrible torments; of which one among the reſt was the thruſting of ſharp Reeds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fleſh and the Nails of his Fingers: After which he had his Head cut off, which the Embaſſador of <hi>France</hi> bought of the Executioner as a precious Relique.</p>
            <p>The other, named <hi>Diamanti,</hi> aged about thirty years, and of a charming Beauty, was rowing naked in a Boat upon a River of <hi>Aſia,</hi> with certain <hi>Turks,</hi> who mov'd with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion that ſo lovely a Man ſhould periſh for want of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing their Religion, put a white Turbant upon his Head. Which done, he was uſed with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:205900:30"/> the ſame ſeverity as <hi>Anthony</hi> was, after he had refuſed the chiefeſt Preferments in the Empire. But a <hi>Jacobin</hi> Monk, who was there at the ſame time, renouncing his Chriſtianity, was the occaſion of their recovering by his Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, what they had loſt by the generous Conſtancy of <hi>Diaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</hi> I could give a more ample Deſcription of the Religion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but having done it in another place, I ſhall not ſtudy to enlarge this Volume.</p>
            <p>Neither was <hi>Demetrius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſhew me what was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City, but extending his kindneſs, reſolv'd to let me ſee what was without. To which purpoſe he invited me to take a walk with him to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-houſe of one <hi>Conſtantine</hi> his particular Friend, diſtant about
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:205900:30"/> ten miles; which we reſolv'd to walk according to the cuſtom of the Country. We ſet out by day-break, and with great delight croſs'd over ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Gardens and Fields plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Olive-trees, promiſing our ſelves a moſt pleaſant Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, perceiving the Sun to riſe upon the Lilies whiteneſs. But contrary to the Maxim of the Weather-wiſe we were deceived. For a black Cloud behind us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven forward by a Weſt wind, ſoon got under the Sun, and deprived us of the ſight of that noble Planet. Preſently the Sky became ſo dark that we could hardly diſcern one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which were the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of a moſt dreadful Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; which, however, did not terrifie me ſo much as the Rain
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:205900:31"/> that followed did me miſchief. For beſides that continuing all that day, it ſoak'd through my Shirt to my very Skin; the Fat Soil of the Fields through which we were to paſs to get the neareſt way, being diſſolv'd, we ſunk in the Mud up to our very Knees, ſo that we were forc'd every ſtep we took to pull out our Legs with our Hands. This ſame Combat with the bad Weather and worſe Way, tired me ſo much, that I was forced to make a ſtop. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs I encourag'd <hi>Monthre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi> to follow <hi>Demetrius;</hi> I bid them alſo drink and be merry, and take no notice of my indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, telling them withal, That after I had reſted my ſelf upon the deſcent of a Turfy Bank, where I was laid down
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:205900:31"/> through meer faintneſs, I would endeavour to overtake them the next day. After that, falling inſenſibly aſleep, I knew not what became of them, till wak'd with the noiſe, I perceiv'd them upon two Camels followed by a Countryman who led a third, which carried me to the Friends Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantine</hi> treated us with that magnificence, that it was eaſie to ſee he had been adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of our coming. But having loſt all my Strength and Spirits, not all the Delicacy of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands could force my languiſhing Appetite; ſo that the good Wine was all the Refreſhment I could take that Evening. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I took ſome pleaſure to ſee the Company fall on ſo heartily, ſometimes caſting my Eyes upon
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:205900:32"/> a Lady that ſate over-againſt me, young, handſome, and plump, yet one that eat no more than my ſelf; which I wondered at the more, becauſe I could not ſee any reaſon ſhe had to be ſo tender-ſtomach'd, I obſerv'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that ſhe would be ſtill ſtaring upon me, and could read in her Eyes that I was not a perſon out of her Favour. However, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty would not permit me to inform my ſelf any farther, and my Indiſpoſition was Excuſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for me to take leave of the Company, that I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Loſſes of my Strength by the Refreſhment of a good Bed. After a ſhort Nap, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd <hi>Monthreſor</hi> earneſtly pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping through the crevice of a Door that lead out of my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber into another, and finding
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:205900:32"/> by my ſtirring, that I was awake, he came to me, and made me put my Head out of Bed, and look through the ſame chink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the next Chamber, where I ſaw a young man performing the Duty of a Chambermaid to the young Lady: But neither of us knew what the meaning of it was; thereupon I fell aſleep again, and <hi>Monthreſor</hi> went to bed. About midnight I was awaked again by the hard tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome body in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; at what time, putting by the Curtain of the Bed, which was of Cloth of Gold, I was ſtrangely ſurprized to ſee the ſame young man in his Shirt, with a Scimiter drawn in his right Hand, and his Eyes ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling like the light that glitter'd out of the Lanthorn which he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:205900:33"/> held in his left, with my own Night-cap. Nor was I leſs ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified to ſee him in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture making toward <hi>Monthre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi>'s Bed; which however, he preſently left to come to mine; and ſo ſoon as he perceived my bare Head, which I thruſt out from between the Curtains to ſee what was the matter; <hi>Oh! is it you,</hi> cry'd he? The noiſe which he made, wakned my Companion, and I at the ſame time leap'd out of my Bed ſtark naked as I was, having lain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Italian</hi> manner, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to eaſe my ſelf, ſnatch'd up my Cloak and wound it about my Arm to ſend off the Blows which the enraged young Fellow laid on without mercy. By this <hi>Monthreſor</hi> coming to my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, claſp'd the young man
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:205900:33"/> about both his Arms, and ſtopp'd his Fury, which was as much as he could do, in regard we had both left our Swords in the place where we ſupp'd. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the Lady coming out of her Chamber, made a hideous out-cry which raiſed all the Houſe, and brought them into the Room; and <hi>Demetrius</hi> without any more to do, took my part. At which the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor began to vomit forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me all the Reproaches and ill Language that his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion could invent, out of a falſe belief, that I had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the Honour of his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſhews my Cap to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> as being the moſt proper Judge of the Treſpaſs which was ſuppoſed to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in his Houſe; and adds,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:205900:34"/> That having heard a noiſe in her Chamber, he haſtned thither and found what I wanted, lying at her Beds feet. However, though the Preſumption were very rational, <hi>Demetrius</hi> had a better opinion of me, as well in reſpect of his experience of my Converſation, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations of his Friends in my behalf, and ſtifly maintain'd that I was a Perſon that ſcorn'd ſuch a diſhonourable Action. On the other ſide, the Lady who had thrown her ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her Brother and me, to ſtop his Fury, conjured him by her own Honour, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing that might tend to her Scandal; alledging, that the Cap might have been carried into the Chamber by ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought-of Accident. This <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:205900:34"/> confirm'd, aſſuring the Company, That the Rats, of which the Houſe was full for want of Cats, the ſight of which he could not endure, did often play him ſuch Tricks, many times carrying away his Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and other Clothes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into one Corner, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into another, and that ſo my Cap might have fallen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally from my Head, and have been carried where the young man found it; therefore he deſired <hi>Laſcaris</hi> to pacifie his Wrath, and me to pardon his zealous Fury in his Siſter's behalf. Thereupon, every one acquieſcing in his Judgment, they all return'd to their Beds. By break of day my Enemy gave me another viſit, not like a Mad-man, but with a ſerene
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:205900:35"/> and ſmiling Countenance, crav'd my Excuſe for the Tranſports of his Rage; and ſo ſaying, he brought me one of his own Shooes that a Rat had likewiſe carried away, all gnaw'd and Vermin-eaten as it was: And this, added he, puts me out of doubt of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. After that he made me privy to his Siſter's Concerns, and his deſign to carry her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately out of the way, that he might releaſe her from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Addreſſes of the Eunuch Governour of <hi>Athens,</hi> who was paſſionately in love with her, but whoſe vain and impotent Careſſes were loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> would fain have had me travelled farther up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country; but in regard I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:205900:35"/> had ſeen enough to judge of the Nature of the reſt by what I had ſeen already, that is to ſay, That it was enriched with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Fruits, abounding in Corn and Oil, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s Liquor, I determined to return to the City, where finding my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord <hi>Epiphanes</hi> tied Legs and Feet by the Fetters of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper which proceeds from Wine and good Chear, where men indulge their Appetites to exceſs, I relieved him with my <hi>Antipodagricon,</hi> or Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Gout; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that our Veſſel was ready to ſet ſail for <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> tho' there ſtill remained many things for me to have ſeen in this ſo highly renowned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Greece;</hi> I rather choſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:205900:36"/> to deferr the Satisfaction of my Curioſity till my Return, than to loſe the opportunity of our Veſſel; ſo that we embark'd the 25th. New-ſtile, and the 15th. Old-ſtile, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as well as the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Scarce were we got clear of the Road, but my uſual Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeized me, which obliged me to keep my Cabin, where I lay ill till we came to <hi>Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> where we arrived the 4th. of <hi>March.</hi> Upon our landing, a <hi>French</hi> Slave that ſtood upon the Key, offered to conduct us to the Houſe of <hi>Signior Lorenzo,</hi> to whom I had Letters to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; by the way we met with two <hi>Turks,</hi> one of which took off my Hat, and with his Foot toſſed it up into the Air, like a Foot-ball, diverting himſelf and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:205900:36"/> his Companion for ſome time with his rude Sport, laughing and houting all the while. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, as our Guide told us, becauſe thoſe ſort of People bear an inveterate hatred to our Habits, which they look upon to be very paltry and ridiculous, nevertheleſs we think them to be very graceful, and account our ſelves the wiſeſt People in the World.</p>
            <p>This Capital City of the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Empire having been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times deſcribed by other Travellers who have been very exact in their relations, I ſhall ſay nothing of it, only that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had ſatisfied my ſelf with the ſight of the Hippodrome, and ſeveral other the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable parts of it, I departed thence the 7th. of <hi>March,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:205900:37"/> the opportunity of a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, which carried me through the Euxine Sea to <hi>Lonati,</hi> where we arrived the 17th. my deſire to ſee <hi>Tartary,</hi> of which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try there has been ſo little ſaid, cauſing me to make choice of that Paſſage. However, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any information that might aſſiſt me to find out the moſt commodious and ſafeſt way to ſteer my Travels, I made it my buſineſs to frequent the Coffee-Houſes, where I had the good luck to meet with <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> a young man, well-featur'd, and infinitely civil, the Son of a rich Merchant of <hi>Jamina</hi> in <hi>Epirus,</hi> famous for the Birth of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and well ſtored with Learning. This Perſon was alſo a Traveller for his pleaſure, and with the ſame deſign that we had, which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:205900:37"/> was to ſee the moſt remote Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, rarely frequented, and of which the Relations are hitherto very imperfect. He underſtood the Turkiſh perfectly well, but excell'd in the Litteral Greek. Seeing therefore that I had a ſmattering of both the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and that our humours correſponded, he was deſirous to make a Third in our Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thereupon we concluded to range the remainder of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky, being inform'd that we ſhould find Veſſels at <hi>Santa Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> which would tranſport us into <hi>Tartary</hi> through the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, and that we might take that way without any danger, having a Janizary to attend us, with whom we might agree for the whole expence of the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. With theſe Inſtructions
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:205900:38"/> we pitch'd upon a Rough hewn Blade, who undertook to conduct us for Twenty five Crowns a Head, for whoſe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, beſides that he lookt like an honeſt ſtout fellow, a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of <hi>Ariſtides's</hi> Acquaintance engag'd. A Crown is a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Real, which Money, as well as that of the <hi>German</hi> Empire and <hi>Holland,</hi> goes through all Turky with <hi>Venetian</hi> Sequins, to the great advantage of Travellers; upon every Sequin you get five Shillings, upon every Real one Shilling.</p>
            <p>Upon the Twentieth of <hi>March</hi> we got a Horſe-back, the Weather being very fair, and ſo continuing till the Thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, at what time we got to <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> by eaſie Journeys, ſetting up our Tents in thoſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:205900:38"/> places which ſeem'd to us moſt convenient; and yet for all that we travell'd at leaſt Twelve Leagues a day. All that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which comprehends <hi>Mingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> and <hi>Georgia,</hi> is ſufficiently beautiful, but ill peopled and conſequently worſe manur'd. The <hi>Georgians</hi> are acompted Hereticks by the Greeks, though they obſerve their Ceremonies. The difference between them conſiſts chiefly in this, that they will not acknowledge the Holy Virgin to be the Mother of God; alleadging that God could have no Mother: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever though they blame the Greeks for being of a contrary Opinion, yet they do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to frequent their Churches in <hi>Italy,</hi> and prefer them before the <hi>Latins. Aristides</hi> and my
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:205900:39"/> ſelf were preſent at their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the Paſſion Week, at what time <hi>Monthreſor</hi> lay ſick of a Dyſentry; but by virtue of an infallible Cure which I brought with me from <hi>Rome</hi> he recover'd, and was in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to put to Sea, the Third of <hi>April,</hi> which we did with a fair Wind that brought us to <hi>Mora</hi> the Seventh. However we did not land there, by reaſon of the Peſtilence that was very violent in that Place: Which was to me a grievous Affliction by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the racking Pains which I endur'd upon the Sea, and which only going aſhore could relieve. Thereupon we were conſtrain'd to put out again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the open Sea, which being offended at our Return, began to murmur, and by and by all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:205900:39"/> in a raging fury began to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the deſtruction of our Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and ſwallow us up in his Mounting Waves. Nor did the Storm ceaſe till ſome hours after Night was ſhut in; but then it became ſo calm and ſmooth that I felt ſome eaſe.</p>
            <p>The next day being the Eighth I got upon the Deck, and deſcrying Land with a ſmall Town about three Miles diſtant from the Shore, I propos'd to our Friends, that we might be row'd aſhore in our Skiff, to which they agreed, and our Captain was no leſs willing, and in reſpect to <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> order'd the Seamen to carry our Luggage to the Town, which afterwards we found to be <hi>Sabatan.</hi> There we were curteouſly receiv'd by the Inhabitants, who careſs'd us after an extraordinary manner,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:205900:40"/> and without any hopes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, in regard there are no Inns in that place, as in <hi>France</hi> and other Countries of Europe; the Perſon that entertains you being ſatisfi'd with having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd a laudable Act of Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Happy was he that could have us; and therefore to pleaſe more then one we divided our ſelves. However though we lodg'd in ſeveral Houſes, we kept together all day long. They alſo recommended to our Service a <hi>Tartarian,</hi> who having liv'd among the <hi>Franks</hi> at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> had learnt the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Language; and therefore finding him inclin'd to ſerve us we accepted of him. And thus having recover'd our former health by reſt and good feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſet forwards again the Eleventh, without any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:205900:40"/> than to travel at a venture in a Country that let us come where we would, we had what we aim'd at.</p>
            <p>About a Mile from <hi>Sabatan</hi> we travell'd over a riſing Ground, from whence we might take a view of the Country; and after we had for ſome time lookt as far as we could ſee, we choſe the South Eaſt, as ſeeming the moſt pleaſant, and ſo march'd on with <hi>Caraman</hi> our <hi>Tartar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, carrying a Basket of Proviſions, with a <hi>Partiſan</hi> in his hand, and his Bow and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows at his Back. We carry'd every one a Carbine in our hands, as well for ſport as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, two Piſtols in our Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and a Scimitar by our ſides; and as for our Coats and Bags of Linnen for change, we
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:205900:41"/> threw them upon a Horſe which we had provided to ſerve us in time of neceſſity. Moreover <hi>Ariſtides</hi> had one more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant than any of the reſt; a ſtout Maſtiff, which he had bred up of a Whelp, fierce to all others but his Maſters Friends; and which his Maſter had arm'd with a ſtrange fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical Cap of Steel to defend him from the Claws and Fangs of Wild Beaſts, which cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his head like the hollow half of a Pruen Stone, ended a little below his Noſe, like the Horn of a Rinoceros, with a Point ſo ſharp to be able to pierce a Bufolo's Skin. This Dogs Name was <hi>Pamphagos,</hi> in plain <hi>Engliſh All-devour.</hi> And thus accouter'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we travell'd all that day till night without meeting any
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:205900:41"/> Living thing; nor was the night leſs tedious to us for want of a good lodging.</p>
            <p>The Twelfth, ſetting forward again betimes in the Morning, and we found by <hi>Caramans</hi> pace, that we had made a ſhift to find the way to our Mouths in the Dark. But when we had made a farther Breach in his Basket at Noon, he began to out-ſtrip us ſo faſt that we were forc'd to order him to keep behind. Toward Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we diſcover'd a Cottage made of Stone without Morter cover'd with Graſs. Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we deſir'd <hi>All-devour</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his Mouth and ſpeak to the Cottage, believing that upon his ſurly ſummons they that were within would make their appearance; but no anſwer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing return'd, we conjectur'd it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:205900:42"/> to be as we found it, empty; and thereupon thought fit to take poſſeſſion, not knowing where to find a better Lodging. The reſt of the Evening we ſpent in cutting Fern for our Bedding. The Wolves however being come, <hi>Monthreſor</hi> ſtrook a light with his ſteel and flint, to the end we might ſup with more pleaſure by the light of a ſmall Wax Candle; <hi>Caraman</hi> was extreamly pleas'd to ſee us feed like Hunters, in hopes that he ſhould have nothing to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next day; and truly there was but a very ſmall Modicum left, which we reſerv'd with an equal proportion of Wine for breakfaſt. Thus after we had ſupp'd we took our repoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſweetly under the Guard of <hi>All-devour,</hi> who kept Sentinel at the Door of the Cottage.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:205900:42"/>
            <p>The Thirteenth <hi>All-devour</hi> ſtarted a Hare, which it was <hi>Monthreſor</hi>'s good fortune to kill. Preſently we got a good heap of Bruſh Wood together to roaſt our Veniſon. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had din'd we agreed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that if any Misfortune ſhould threaten us, the laſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhould inherit all the Goods.</p>
            <p>All this while the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of wanting Victuals had put us quite out of conceit with theſe Deſerts, at what time we diſcover'd about four Miles off a riſing Hillock, of which the White and Green put it into our heads that we ſhould make a diſcovery what it really was. Thereupon we made up to it, and the nearer we approach'd the Objects rendring themſelves more diſtinct, at length we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:205900:43"/> them to be a knot of Shepherds Lodgings, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by <hi>Caraman</hi> the Cauſe of our coming, feaſted us in their Tents to the beſt of their Power: For their uſual Dyet is Milk, Cheeſe, Butter and Pulſe, ſuch as the Earth naturally produces without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Some there are that eat Fleſh; but they are lookt upon as Savages and Brutes. They have alſo a ſort of Wheat which grows like their Pulſe without the aſſiſtance of Husbandry; but they make no Bread of it, no more than they make Wine of their Grapes. In a word, they live upon all the Productions of the Earth, which it affords them without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preparation than that of nature. Nevertheleſs, as having the forecaſt of Bees and Emets,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:205900:43"/> they make their Proviſion in its proper Seaſons againſt Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>As to their Stature, they are generally about four foot and a half high, but never exceed five. Their Faces are generally ſquare, but well ſhap'd, only that their Noſes are generally flat: They are ſtrong and couragious; their Cloathing for the more careleſs ſort is only a Sheeps Skin; but the more neat and curious make uſe of the Skins of Hares, Martins, Foxes or Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which they kill in Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nor is the Habit of the Women much different from that of the Men; for they ſay that the Beard is a ſufficient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between the two Sexes. They are faithful to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, equally ſharing with them in their Cares and Pains,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:205900:44"/> according to the practiſe of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> When they have a mind to eat, their Proviſion is brought in an old <hi>Hart,</hi> or <hi>Elan</hi>'s Skin; which being ſpread upon the Ground ſerves inſtead of a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Napkin and Platter much like the Greeks and Turks; they ſit down upon Cuſhions made of Sheep Skins with the Wooll on; every one takes what beſt pleaſes his Palate. For they have Fruits of all ſorts, freſh in their Seaſon, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in Winter; Apples, Pears, Cherries, Figs, Grapes, Wheat, Milk, and Roots, which they preſerve in Honey inſtead of Salt, of which they make no uſe at all; they begin their Meals with a large draught of Milk, and ſo conclude them. After that, if they chance to be a drye, they quench their Thirſts
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:205900:44"/> with the next fair Water they meet. They lye in their Cloaths upon Skins ſpread upon the Ground, and cover themſelves with Skins of the ſame ſort: Which I find to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient than the Beds of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> where Feathers ſerve for Bed and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlet.</p>
            <p>They are never ſick, and therefore Phyſick is not known among them. They only dye of old Age, upon the utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of their Natural heat, which happens ſooner or later, according to the Compoſition which they firſt receiv'd in their Mothers Womb. I once askt a decrepid old Man, whether he were not afraid of Death? Who being ſurpriz'd at the Novelty of a Queſtion never propos'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, made anſwer, That
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:205900:45"/> there was nothing to be fear'd where there was nothing of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. That he conceiv'd Death to be nothing elſe but a Ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Motions of Action and Thought: That all evil conſiſted in the Thought, and therefore there could be no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering where there is a Ceſſation of Thought. I could not but admire at ſuch Philoſophy as this in a Perſon ſo Illiterate; for they are ſo far from addicting themſelves to ſtudy, that they have not any knowledge of Books. In the next place I caus'd him to be ask'd of what Religion he was? To which he made this Return, That he was a Shepherd by Profeſſion; nor could I draw any other anſwer from him. They abide in the Places of which they make choice, ſo long as their Flocks
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:205900:45"/> find any thing to feed upon. Afterwards they remove into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts, under the Conduct of one who is their Chief. They were ſo Civil, that perceiving we wanted a Tent, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented us with one of their own; together with a Cart and four Cows to draw it, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſervice that they did us, might alſo feed us with their Milk. Their Tents are made of white Skins, dreſt with the Hair on; which colour they make choice of above all others, to the end their Tents may be diſcern'd at a diſtance, which prevents others that have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to change their ſtations, to remove to a place already poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd.</p>
            <p>The Fifteenth we took leave of our Hoſts, laden with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for Eight days, which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:205900:46"/> they put into our Cart; for which we preſented them with ſeveral <hi>Italian</hi> Trifles, very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to them by reaſon of their Novelty.</p>
            <p>From thence we went on ſlowly, and by ſhort Journeys, taking up our Lodging an hour before Night, which we ſpent either in eating or ſleeping, one of our Company always keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing watch in his Turn; not for fear of Robbers, or Barbarous ſpoilers of Paſſengers; for there are no ſuch Uſages among them, but for fear of the wild Beaſts, which otherwiſe might have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted our Perſons, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd our Cows, for whoſe Paſturage our Sentinel had in charge to provide, with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of <hi>All-devour,</hi> We al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made a ſtop in the day time, as well to reſt our ſelves, as to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:205900:46"/> refreſh our ſelves with a ſhort Meal, which was generally by the ſide of a Fountain, which wanting of, we drank at the charge of our Cows.</p>
            <p>The Twentieth we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the heat of the Sun, that we were far diſtant from the North; which heat was ſo violent, that the Reflection of it from a Rock upon our right hand, put <hi>Ariſtides</hi> into a violent Fit of the Headach, who having at length met with a convenient Shade, under the favour of the Elbow of a Hillock, made bold to ſit down upon certain Stones, which long time had looſen'd and rowl'd down from the Rock; beſides that our hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, the conveniency of the Place invited us to take our Repaſt, provided we could meet with any Water. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:205900:47"/> 
               <hi>Monthreſor</hi> and my ſelf, leaving our ſick Friend to his Repoſe under the Guard of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raman,</hi> went to look out for ſome Water, judging by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Place, that we could not be far off from a Spring: Nor were we deceiv'd, for not far off, we diſcovered a large Hind going to cool himſelf in a wide receptacle of ſpring water, not unlike to that which proves the Spring of a wide River near the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at the foot of <hi>Tourmagne</hi> at <hi>Nimes</hi> in <hi>Languedoc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Beaſt was nothing ſcared either at the ſight of us, or our Fire-arms; nor did we think it Humanity to injure our Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctreſs. But finding the Rock to open in that place, our Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity led us to enter the Hole; wherein about ten paces from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:205900:47"/> the entrance, we found a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Hall very convenient for us to take the benefit of the cool Air. The rocky part was ſo odly contrived, that you would have taken it for the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of a Monk of <hi>Pic-Puz,</hi> had you been near <hi>Paris.</hi> The bottom of the Grotto was cleft into an Aſcent, the firſt ſteps of which did not ſeem very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie. Thereupon our Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leading us further, <hi>Monthre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi> ſtrook a light, by vertue of which we purſued the Aſcent for about half a quarter of an Hour with ſome difficulty, till at length we came to another Hall larger and fairer than that below. Thence we paſſed into a Gallery that led into ſeveral others, very much reſembling thoſe of <hi>Chinon;</hi> for that here as well as there, the moiſture of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:205900:48"/> the Earth ſtraining it ſelf through her Veins in ſo many diſtinct, as it were, Springs of Water, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms it ſelf into ſo many Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal Pendants, ſticking and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to the Wall, like ſo many little Mirrours, in a concave and unequal form, not inferiour to the Ice flakes of <hi>Murrhan,</hi> which are poliſh'd at <hi>Venice.</hi> And thus Nature having, as it were in Sport, ſhewn us what ſhe can do alone without the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Art, ſeem'd to teach us the Original of Rivers: For ſhe permits the remainder of this matter, after ſhe has form'd theſe rare Pieces of Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to fall partly by way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation from the point of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd multitude of Pyramids, hanging athwart this ſo richly frettiz'd Ceiling, partly trickling from the glittering Concave up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:205900:48"/> the Pavement that receives it; whence the whole conveys it ſelf into ſeveral Channels to be thence conducted into larger Receptacles, ſituated at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one from another, till it come to the laſt and largeſt of all, whence it unfolds it ſelf like a Napkin, which the violence of the Air opens as it hangs, till at length it deſcends in a kind of ſmall Rain, colour'd by the Reflection of the Sun that ſhoots in through the hole at the top, into a profound Abyſs, not to be beheld without Terror and Amazement. Theſe Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons put me out of doubt, that that ſame Water which I knew to be a ramaſsment of diſtilled Drops, was the Water that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally enlarg'd the Receptacle firſt mentioned, and to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that ſprings from it. Whence
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:205900:49"/> I concluded that all other Springs have the ſame original; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be, that the Air condens'd by Cold, diſſolve into moiſture; or whether the Earth imbibe this Humour by filtration, or otherwiſe, as I ſet forth in my new Syſtem of Philoſophy. And thus ſatisfied with a ſight ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, we return'd to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides,</hi> to whom we imparted our Diſcoveries; who thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would needs have us carry our Dinner thither, to the end we might have the pleaſure of eating in ſuch a delicious Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting houſe.</p>
            <p>The 21st. we had nothing but Plains on every ſide very rich in Paſturage, which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we met ſeveral Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds who had left their Tents, where only Night requires their Attendance.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:205900:49"/>
            <p>The 23d. we arrived at the foot of a Mountain cover'd with Box, out of which the Lake called the Swan's Lake, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it ſelf through a hole about ten foot below the top, among the Boughs of a pleaſant Wood; where Nature has ſo ordered the ſloping of the Rock, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Water ſpouts forth like ſo many Waves, ſometimes ſpurts out like a Plume of Feathers, and ſometimes like an Agret; afterwards falling all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, like a Veil, through the ſides of a Demi-oval, eight Foot in Diameter, it throws it ſelf into a neighbouring River, which in Summer is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the Shepherds that feed their Flocks in the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows which it waters. In this River while they waſh their Sheep, they ſport with their
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:205900:50"/> Sheperdeſſes; every one cocker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and careſſing his own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. Which done, they fall to their Muſick, playing ſeveral Tunes upon Flutes made of the Rine of Willows that cover the Bank; upon which they alſo ſit while they aſſwage the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which their bathing has excited and ſharpen'd, putting their own Victuals altogether. One day they gave us a Viſit at our Imcampment, where we preſented them with ſeveral Glaſs Jewels, ſuch as they make at <hi>Nevers,</hi> in lieu of which, they brought us their Proviſions, more than our Cart would carry.</p>
            <p>The 24th. we came to a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, out of which there iſſued a Beaſt about the bigneſs of an Elephant, which it reſembled in every thing elſe but the <hi>Probo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcis.</hi> This Beaſt perceiving us,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:205900:50"/> recovered the Wood, where I could ſee him feed upon the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Branches of the Trees, not being able to nibble the Graſs by reaſon of the tallneſs of his head. Thereupon judging it to be tame, I went up to it, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd it ſome Wheat in the Skirt of my Coat, which it ſwallow'd with ſome ſeeming acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment for my kindneſs, and kept us Company all the time we ſtaid there under the ſhade of the Oakes.</p>
            <p>The 25th. we made a full ſtop.</p>
            <p>The 26th. being advertiſed by <hi>Caraman,</hi> that a Company of neighbouring Shepherds were packing up their Tents, with an intention to change their poſt, and that we ſhould be very welcome in their Company; we accepted the Propoſal, as well to continue our Journey with the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:205900:51"/> more convenience, as to obſerve the Form and Cuſtom of their March, which is thus: The day before the Captain gives notice by the found of a Horn, that they are to be ready the next day. At what time the ſignal is no ſooner given (ſo punctual they are) but they begin their March in this Order. Firſt moves the Standard, which is the Head of Bull crowned with Flowers, which they ſtick upright in the Ground when there is any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of encamping: After that follow the Pipers afoot; the Captain immediately goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Children which are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Carts, with their Tutors, whoſe buſineſs it is to have an inſpection into their Manners; next the Women and aged Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple carried likewiſe in Carts drawn by Bulls, for they have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:205900:51"/> no Oxen, neither is it their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to geld any other Creatures, deteſting above all things that ſort of Mutilation, ſo familiar among men in <hi>Italy,</hi> as injurious to Nature. After theſe follow the men in the full vigour of their years, together with the Baggage, the Guard of which belongs to them, and all the way they laugh and ſing, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dance. Two hours before night they make a ſtop, at what time every Maſter of a Family carries what Proviſion is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to his own People in the Carts. We followed them in our Cart till the 28. at what time we took our leaves, becauſe they reſolv'd to tarry, and we reſolv'd to go farther.</p>
            <p>The 29th. we met with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Huntſmen, who, as they told us, are another ſort of wild
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:205900:52"/> 
               <hi>Tartars,</hi> who feed and cloath themſelves with the Fleſh and Skins of the Beaſts which they take; and to that purpoſe making continual War upon the poor Creatures, with whom they combat, arm'd with a Bow and a Cutlace: Here we made a ſtop, and after Dinner had the ſatisfaction to ſee a Tyger pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by two of theſe Champions. So ſoon as they perceived the Beaſt, they preſently let fly their Arrows againſt him, of which the firſt flight is not intended to do him any great harm, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to provoke him the more. But when they perceive the Beaſt to make at them in revenge of the Injury, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow their Arrows upon him thick and three-fold, till the poor Creature having received ſeveral Wounds in his Body, is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:205900:52"/> forc'd to yield. At what time one of the Hunters boldly ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon him, cuts off his Head with his Cutlace: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they will ſtruggle with the Beaſt, but without any danger, for that they are very nimble, and never alone, otherwiſe the Beaſt would have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>The 30th. we paſſed through a Hamlet, where we deſired Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, which they let us have for our Money. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Monthreſor</hi> finding himſelf in a Veniſon-Country, reſolv'd to taſte of it; to which purpoſe we made a ſtop about Noon, and after a ſhort Repaſt, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to beat the Fields, with <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raman</hi> in his Company, while <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and my ſelf ſet up the Tent, and went to cut Wood for our Kitchen. Toward Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:205900:53"/> our Huntſmen returned loaden with Hares, Pheaſants, and Partridges, which we roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a woodden-Spit, and feaſted our ſelves that Night, if a Feaſt could be without Wine; but we were pretty well accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed by this time to want it. The firſt of <hi>May</hi> we ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward betimes in the Morning, reſolved for the future to make our beſt of the cool of the day, finding the heats to be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious. But <hi>Monthreſor</hi> allur'd with the Succeſs he had the day before, was reſolved to have the other Hunting-Bout together with his Companion, whom he never brought back again. For the poor <hi>Tartar</hi> was ſurpriſed by a <hi>Tyger,</hi> which leaping of a ſudden upon him, gave him a gripe by the Neck, and choak'd him before his Maſter could
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:205900:53"/> come to his relief, who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs revenged his Death with his Scimitar, which he ran full into the Body of the Beaſt over gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his Prey; with which Wound the <hi>Tyger</hi> died, only giving <hi>Monthreſor</hi> a ſlight Nip in the Arm, which did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Victor however from fleaing him, that he might have the Spoils of his Enemy, which he preferred before thoſe of an <hi>Aga.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this accident were we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of our Speech, as if all our three Tongues had been cut out, which cauſed us to bewail our Loſs ſo much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we thought it irreparable. We were now to renounce the Society of Men, unleſs we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to appear among them as mute Beaſts. However, we did not forbear to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:205900:54"/> in hopes of ſome lucky Accident before we had ſpent all our Victuals, with which we were furniſh'd for eight days; all which time we were continually upon the march, but when we either eat or ſlept, ſteering our courſe all along directly againſt the South-Eaſt, <hi>All-devour</hi> ſerving us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Forerunner, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacquing with a Heroick Valour all that came in his way. But the moſt famous of his Exploits was this: A very fierce Lyon met him, and thought to have terrified him with his roaring; but <hi>All devour</hi> on the contrary growls, barks, advances, and having joyn'd him at four leaps, nimbly fixes upon his back, and preſently made him ſenſible of the ſharpneſs of his Fangs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Lyon endeavouring to ſhake off his Burden, frisk'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:205900:54"/> in ſuch a manner, that he threw his Rider, and then flew open jaw'd upon his Antagoniſt with a deſign to gripe him by the Neck; but <hi>All-devour</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him; fixing his Steel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn ſo directly in the Palate of his Enemy, that he thruſt it quite through and through. But then <hi>Ariſtides</hi> coming in ſeaſonably to <hi>All devour</hi>'s relief, put an end to the Combat with his Scimitar, unwilling to hazard another en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>
            <p>The lovely clear Water that glided along by the ſide of a Wood whither we came the 6th. of <hi>May,</hi> invited us to make a ſtop. And here it was that <hi>Monthreſor,</hi> notwithſtanding the fatal Misfortune of <hi>Carraman,</hi> and all our friendly Perſwaſions to the contrary, would needs gratifie that extraordinary Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:205900:55"/> which he had for Hunting. Thereupon <hi>Ariſtides</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to keep him company, I was left alone to get ready the Lardings againſt their return: And I had the more hopes of his Succeſs, in regard that <hi>All devour</hi> followed his Maſter. Nor had I been deceived, had they had none but Beaſts to contend with; but a Deſtiny far different at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Monthreſor.</hi> For after they had rang'd about for ſome hours, they came to a Lake ſo clear and clean at the bottom, that it invited both, being heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Exerciſe, and ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat of the Sun, to go into the Lake and bathe themſelves. As for <hi>Ariſtides</hi> becauſe he could not ſwim, he would not truſt himſelf out of his depth, uſing only a medicinal Bath by the Banks of the Lake, while <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threſor</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:205900:55"/> diverted and pleaſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with cutting the ſmooth and liquid Plain through all its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions. He tried its depth by diving to the bottom, its breadth and length in imitation of the Frog. Sometimes he laid himſelf upon his Back to eaſe himſelf; afterwards reſuming the uſe of his Limbs with more vigor, with a deſign to croſs the Lake, he met with a Current ſo rapid, that it carried him to the entrance of a Cavern hollowed under the Mountain that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred upon one ſide of the Lake, where he vaniſh'd of a ſudden from <hi>Ariſtides</hi>'s ſight, who made me the Relation with Tears in his Eyes for the Loſs of a Perſon ſo dear to him. I ſpent the night in extremity of Sorrow, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day-light, which no ſooner appear'd, but I went and viewed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:205900:56"/> exactly the ſeveral Places, of which when I had conſider'd all the Circumſtances, I deſpair'd of ever ſeeing my Friend again.</p>
            <p>The Eighth there aroſe ſuch a furious Tempeſt, accompany'd with Rain and Thunder, as if the World had been returning to its firſt <hi>Chaos,</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat my Miſeries, I had the Misfortune to ſee <hi>Ariſtides</hi> ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd to the Earth by a Flaſh of Lightning, and thrown four Paces at leaſt before the Cart which I follow'd; I threw my ſelf upon him for ſome time quite ſenceleſs; but then reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering my ſelf, I began to think that death had put an end to their Miſeries, and that the end of my Friends Misfortunes was but the beginning of my own, in a ſtrange Country, of which the Language and Roads were to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:205900:56"/> me unknown, without aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, without ſupport, without Proviſions or means of ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. 'Tis true I had Gold and Jewels both of my own and of my deceas'd Companions; but I neither knew how to trade, nor how to agree with any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that could bring me to the Sea-ſide, where I might get a convenience to carry me back into my own Country; which I lookt upon as my beſt way. At laſt conſidering that I could get nothing by ſtaying where I was, I reſolv'd in the firſt place to pay my laſt devoires of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to my deceaſed Friend: To which purpoſe I made uſe of my Sword to dig a grave in the Earth four fingers deep, where I laid him at his full length, and cover'd him with the ſame Turf which I had par'd
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:205900:57"/> off: For by our diſcourſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I underſtood that ſuch a Sepulcher pleas'd him beſt; for he did not like that Cuſtom of the Chriſtians to bury in Churches, who not content with a deep Grave, cover the dead Body with a heavy Free-ſtone. Whereas, ſaid he, it is much better to carry our Carkaſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fields, where their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance diſſolving, and ſerving to nouriſh the Plants, receives a kind of new Life; by which means the wrong done to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Mortality is in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure repair'd. He alſo tax'd of ſottiſhneſs and injuſtice the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of embalming; of ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe that Death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no benefit by it: of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice becauſe it defrauds Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her Rights; for 'tis her deſire that the Corruption of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:205900:57"/> one ſhould be attended by the Generation of another, to which Perfumes are an Enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they delay the Diſſolution of the Body which they embalme.</p>
            <p>After all leaving <hi>All-devoure</hi> upon his Maſters Grave, from whence I could by no means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure him, I reſolv'd to abandon my ſelf to Fortune, and to the guidance of the Cows; which I determin'd ſhould take their own fancy, without troubling my ſelf any farther than only to follow them: In which diſtreſs, my Proviſions failing me in three days, I was reduc'd to Milk; upon which I liv'd for three Weeks together, wandring through Deſerts where I could not diſcern the leaſt print of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Footſtep. In the day time I took care to pick up all the Bruſh Wood and dry Sticks I could find
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:205900:58"/> to make a Fire in the night, which I underſtood by the <hi>Tartars</hi> the wild Beaſts would never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. One time among the reſt meditating like a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, I came to a Lake, the deceitful Banks of which giving way to my Horſes Feet, we fell both into the Water, which was of an ill taſte, and began to fill my Mouth. Preſently I threw my ſelf off my Horſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Land, and laid hold of the firſt Roots I could light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thinking to get up out of the Water, but they being too weak to bear my weight I fell in again; nor had I any other way to get out, but by graſping the Mudd, and ſo taking hold of other Roots ſtronger than the former, by which means I drew my ſelf to the Shore. So full was I of my <hi>Seneca</hi> at that time;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:205900:58"/> and by reading him become ſo familiar with Death, that inſtead of being affrighted to ſee him ſo near me, I reaſon'd with my ſelf in falling, with the ſame Tranquillity of mind as I could have done at the greateſt diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from danger. My Horſe had the Misfortune to remain there; but I the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune three days after to light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Country well manur'd. I ſaw that the Lands were till'd, and fenc'd with Diches as in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, that the Medows were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizado'd, the Vinyards wall'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and a little farther I met with Gardens and Orchards plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to Art. This change of the Scene put me in hopes that I ſhould ſuddenly meet with Men of our own Faſhions. And with theſe hopes I ſtill went on, when by and by I came to a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:205900:59"/> place where I heard People talk on the orher ſide of a Wall. Upon which I made a ſtop, and liſtning underſtood their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to be <hi>Greek.</hi> What! thought I to my ſelf, am I mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly tranſported into <hi>Greece?</hi> Thereupon I went up into my Cart to ſee whither I could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any thing like to what I had heard; and then I ſaw Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple weeding a Field that was ſown with Corn, and planted with Vines after the manner of <hi>Naples.</hi> At firſt I took time to conſider, not without aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Perſons who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Country Meen, ſhould employ themſelves in Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry. I rous'd my ſelf, I felt my ſelf, and yet could hardly believe my ſelf, or rather I could not believe but that I dreamt, or that my Life had been only a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:205900:59"/> Dream, till this very Moment. However at length I opened my Lips and ſaluted the Gentlemen with a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>God ſave ye.</hi> Thereupon they ſtar'd upon me, and I ask'd them in what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try I was? In the Territories of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> cry'd they, and you are welcome. Thereupon I made them a ſhort Relation of my Misfortunes; upon which one of the Company by conſent of the reſt came to me, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to drive my Cart, brought me to a Country Houſe, about Five hunder'd Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diſtant; where ſo ſoon as we came into the firſt Court, another took my Cows and led them to the Stable, while my Guide carry'd me into the Houſe, the neatneſs of which, together with the Gaietry of the People charm'd me at firſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:205900:60"/> ſight; nor did they delay to bring me in Refreſhments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. Judge you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I were not overjoy'd at a happineſs ſo unexpected, and whether I did not with Pleaſure behold the Wine in the Glaſſes, not having taſted any in ſo long time before. The Collation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, I was conducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Chamber, where they told me I might take my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at leiſure, and make uſe of the Conveniencies of the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as long as I pleas'd. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſeeing the Bed handſom and decently adorn'd, as much weary as I was, I made haſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and lay till the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very late.</p>
            <p>In this delightful Manſion I ſpent three days, amidſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Sports of a moſt Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Youthfulneſs, with which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:205900:60"/> they intermix'd the Labours of Country Husbandry, while the young Virgins and Lads met e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Evening to ſing, dance, and play together at <hi>Colin-Mail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard</hi> or Blind-man's Buff; while ſuch as were more ſeriouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd more ſeriouſly entertain'd each other. For they had all the Liberty to do what they pleas'd, in regard there were none that would abuſe their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; ſo vertuous were their Inclinations by the means of good Education, with which they were ſeaſon'd in their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der years. <hi>Callisthenes,</hi> the Maſter of the Society kept me Company continually; ſo that whether the Duty of his Office oblig'd him to go abroad, or whether he had a deſire himſelf to take a walk, he would ſtill have me to make one. So that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:205900:61"/> I had the leiſure to inform my ſelf touching the Original and Government of this Petty State; of which that Noble Gentleman gave me an Accompt, with that neatneſs which I am not able to imitate.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid he, ſince it is your intention to ſojourn here for ſome time, and that you have laid your deſign to viſit our Chief City. I will paſs by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, which you will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to obſerve of your ſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting my ſelf to diſpoſe your Mind to the underſtanding of what you ſhall ſee, by an exact Relation of our Eſtabliſhment and Policy.</p>
            <p>After the Death of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> his Courtiers ſhar'd his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire among themſelves, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd it after a manner ſo far from the Intentions of that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:205900:61"/> Prince, who always had a moſt particular eſteem for Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, that they not able to endure the Tyranny of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, after a Conſultation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming their Wiſdom, forſook <hi>Athens,</hi> carrying their Families along with them, to ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſome part of the World, which they could find more Comodious for them, and there to live under Laws, of which themſelves were the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and which we obſerve to this day. The reſt of the Wiſe Men of <hi>Greece</hi> being inform'd of this deſign were deſirous to be of the Company, and all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carry along with them what they had of moſt precious Value, more eſpecially the Books which you will ſee in the great Library at <hi>Heliopolis.</hi> Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving without danger croſs'd the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:205900:62"/> Seas that ſeparate us from our Ancient Country, ſo ſoon as they got a ſhore and ſaw the Land inhabited, they deem'd it a horrible attempt to expel the Inhabitants, only they deſir'd free paſſage, which was granted them, and ſo they went forward, being reſolv'd to make War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on none, unleſs thereto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd; nor to ſettle in any place to the prejudice of the Ancient Poſſeſſors, though they might have done it, as being ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly numerous, and well provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Arms. After they had wander'd two Years and two Months, at length they came to this Sunny Region, which when they found abandon'd, here they ſtopp'd, and ſatisfi'd themſelves with the Fruits which they found growing here and there among the Plants, that Nature volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:205900:62"/> produc'd, the ſame upon which we live at this day; tho' perhaps ſomewhat bettter, through the Induſtry of our Progenitors, who grubb'd up the Lands, and in proceſs of time brought them to that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, wherein we ſtill preſerve them. They ſhared the pains and labour of Tillage one among another, every one according to his beſt Skill, making uſe of the Inſtruments and knowledge which they had brought along with them; ſome for planting Vinyards, others for ſowing, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for forging the Smiths work, and others for building and Architecture. When they either cut or grubb'd up the Wood, they did not ſo deſtroy it, but that they reſerv'd at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient diſtances, enough for Firing, or for other uſes; having
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:205900:63"/> divided the Country, which in Diameter is Four hunder'd and fourſcore Furlongs, which is Fifty nine <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles, into as many Cantons and Country Seats, as it contains at this day. Afterwards they built a City in the very Navel of their Teritory, for the ſeat or reſidence of the Soul of this Myſterious Body, from the middle equally to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence all the Parts of its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference. This City they call'd <hi>Heliopolis</hi> in Honour of the Sun, which we believe to be the Center of the World, and the Heart from which thoſe Spirits flow that enliven it. After that, they took into Conſideration all the Forms of Government of which they had any knowledge, either by their own experience or by reading, and obſerving the defects of each, they thought
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:205900:63"/> it more to the purpoſe to cull out of every one what they deem'd to be moſt profitable, taking the liberty to add or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, as they thought it moſt ſuitable for the Common Good, as aiming to Erect this their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Government upon the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and Foundation of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well order. To this purpoſe they agreed upon a General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, where all the Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty years ſhould have a Right to vote: So that of twelve thouſand Souls, which made up the whole Body, three thouſand were privileg'd to be at the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, partly Philoſophers, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of other Profeſſions who had run the ſame Riſco, either for Affection or Intereſt. Out of theſe three they made choice of a thouſand, to whom they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Determination of all
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:205900:64"/> their Concerns, having ſo great a Veneration for them, that they believ'd them Infallible. But afterwards conſidering that the number was too great, they choſe rather to loſe their ſhare which they had in the Soveraign Government of a growing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, than to expoſe it to Confuſion, which uſually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, when a number too vaſt is therein concern'd. Thereupon they reduc'd their number to three hundred, to whom they ſurrender'd the whole Authority which had been ſurrender'd to them by the General Aſſembly. Which three hundred being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the neceſſity of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident or Chief, made choice of <hi>Miſargyre,</hi> whom they inveſted with an Authority to make Laws, and to call together the Council for their Approbation. This Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:205900:64"/> not ſo much reverenc'd for his Age, as for the integrity of his manners, which was known to all the People, found little or no difficulty to eſtabliſh what he thought moſt convenient; nor did he propoſe any thing but what was highly to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded. And therefore having ſummon'd a Council about eight days after, he thus deliver'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <q>Gentlemen, having retired both my ſelf and my own Thoughts, that I might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Truſt to me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, inſtead of purſuing the uſual Stratagem of Legiſlators, who were wont to feign Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with the Gods, thereby to oblige the People to a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Laws, I have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly examin'd the various Thoughts that turmoil'd my
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:205900:65"/> mind, to make a choice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and thereupon have reduc'd them all to one ſingle Law, the only Law that ever I heard of in all my life, and which I believe to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by all that are endued with a clear Underſtanding; and this is the Law of Nature, imprinted in our Hearts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd and acknowledged by all thoſe who have not a Reaſon perverted and diſordered by their Paſſions; and therefore to come to the Mark at which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Legiſlator chiefly ought to aim, that is to ſay, the maintaining of Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong this People, who have willingly ſubmitted themſelves under our Conduct, I think it ſufficient inceſſantly to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them to follow the Luſtre of that <hi>Flambeau</hi> which enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:205900:65"/> them to obey Reaſon, and above all the lovely Precept which that divine Miſtreſs infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into the Breaſt of all Men. The Nature of man is his Reaſon. Does not ſhe alone teach every particular man not to do to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother what he would not have done to himſelf? Now this Command alone being pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually obſerv'd, is not this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſufficient to preſerve peace among men? And therefore let it be ſufficient for us to ordain, That the moſt prudent among us be oblig'd to undeceive all thoſe, in whom falſe Miſtakes and Prejudices have ſtifled the Sentiments which Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires into us, for by this means we ſhall avoid multitude of Laws, and the Traſh and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery of Proceſs that attends them. Now there is no need
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:205900:66"/> of publiſhing this Law of our Reaſon, it is already within us: But in regard the Employments of Life, or our Paſſions veiling and clouding our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, hinder ſeveral from taking notice of it, my Opinion is to publiſh a Decree, That every Maſter of a Family have fairly written in large Characters, and in the moſt conſpicuous part of his Houſe theſe two words, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Follow Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to the end that being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thus in view, it may be never out of their Memory. Let us alſo make another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, That our Children be well educated in purſuance of this Law. Let them be taught betimes, in the firſt place, that by it all Civil and Criminal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes ought to be determined, according to the Sentence of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:205900:66"/> thoſe wiſe Men, with whom the Office and Dignity of the Magiſtracy is entruſted.</q>
            <p>Then having divided all the People into four diſtinct <hi>Claſſes,</hi> of Children to the Age of ſeven years; of Youths, till eighteen; of young Men, till thirty; and of Men in their perfection, from thirty to the end of their lives, he ordain'd that the firſt ſhould remain purely under the tuition of their Parents, who beſides their inſtructing them in good Manners, ſhould alſo teach them to read: That from thence they ſhould be ſent to the ſeveral Schools, there to be inſtructed by Maſters choſen by the <hi>Council,</hi> in the liberal Arts, in Military Diſcipline, and in Moral and Natural Philoſophy: That ſuch as ſhould be deem'd uncapable of learning the Sciences, ſhould
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:205900:67"/> be put to Trades and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures moſt ſuitable to their <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>'s; for certain it is, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, beſides an inclination to Arts, furniſhes us alſo with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties neceſſary to attain thoſe Arts. That being arriv'd to the Age of the third <hi>Claſſis,</hi> they ſhould be ſent to the Country-Houſes, where after they had ſerv'd twelve years under the Directions of a Governour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by the <hi>Council,</hi> they ſhould return to the City to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and then to ſpend the reſt of their days in Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. That the young Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins alſo ſhould be brought up in Schools apart, and inſtructed in Arts moſt ſuitable to their Sex, then ſent into the Country for the Country husbanding, under the care of a Miſtreſs who ſhould be anſwerable for their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:205900:67"/> to the Council; with this difference only, that they ſhould ſerve no longer than only twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five years of age, and then to be ſent home to their Parents to be married at their diſcretion, preferring before all, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom they ſhall have engag'd their Affections in the Country, whoſe Diſpoſitions they have more reaſon to know than thoſe of others whom they never ſaw in their lives.</p>
            <p>Then conſidering that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences among Citizens generally proceed from diſputes about Property, it was ordain'd, That every thing ſhould be in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and that there ſhould be Magazines in ſeveral Quarters of the City; whence there ſhould be a diſtribution made of all things neceſſary for Food and Rayment. They alſo enacted
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:205900:68"/> ſeveral other Laws and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, of which you will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently be inform'd if you make any ſtay among us.</p>
            <p>He alſo propos'd to continue this number of three hundred, the members of which ſhould be call'd <hi>Wiſe Men:</hi> That thirty of the moſt ancient of this number receiv'd, ſhould be of the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Council, to the Aſſiſtance of which the reſt ſhould be called upon extraordinary Occaſions, when the thirty ſhould think it expedient; and that theſe thirty ſhould have for their Preſident the moſt ancient among them, who ſhould be alſo the chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the <hi>State;</hi> and that when one Place fell vacant, it ſhould be fill'd up with the moſt ancient of the hundred and ſeventy, and his place ſhould be ſupplied by one choſen by the <hi>Thirty.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:205900:68"/>
            <p>All this was approved by the three hundred; and to the end theſe Conſtitutions might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main inviolable to perpetuity, as the fundamental Law of the Kingdom, they ſummon'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther once more the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, who having heard theſe Conſtitutions read, ſubſcrib'd them without the leaſt Heſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, promiſing to obſerve and defend them with their lives; and unanimouſly pronouncing an <hi>Anathema</hi> upon all ſuch as hereafter prove refractary and diſobedient; that is to ſay, the Curſe of Baniſhment, which is indeed the only Puniſhment that we inflict for the higheſt Crimes, and which we fear more than Death. So that of three of our Citizens that have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd in all ſince the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of our Commonwealth,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:205900:69"/> to this preſent time, there was not one but would have rather choſen to have been his own Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, than to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd his Country by perpetual Baniſhment. <hi>Miſangyres</hi> alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gave teſtimony of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his Soul by his ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to thoſe Ordinances which he had made; for that in regard he was not the moſt ancient of the Society, he ſurrendred his Preſidentſhip to his Senior: but it was anſwer'd him, That as to that particular, the Law was not to take place till after his Death, and ſo oblig'd him to keep his Station. From that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Thirty</hi> have been So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Rulers in all affairs both private and publick. The reſt are entruſted with the Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency over the Tribes, and Inſpection into the Schools, the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:205900:69"/> Manufactures and Magazines. They are alſo the firſt Judges of all differences that ariſe within the ſeveral Cantons where they dwell, from whom becauſe they are look'd upon as they are, to be Perſons of great Equity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, you ſhall very rarely hear of any Appeals to the <hi>Thirty</hi> from their Determinations.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe gave me ſo great an <hi>Idea</hi> of the City, that I moſt earneſtly deſir'd him to vouchſafe me an occaſion of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with the firſt opportunity. Thereupon, to morrow, ſaid he, I ſhall ſend away the Carts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to order, by which means you will have the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of going along with my Deputy, to whom I will give order to be your Guide, and to preſent you to the <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> of this Precinct, who will take care
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:205900:70"/> of your perſon. Theſe Waggons which are built much after the manner of <hi>Holland,</hi> are drawn by Bulls that bear the mark of the Country-houſe that ſends them, and of the Tribe to which they belong; and after they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd their Proviſions into the Magazines, they carry back what is contain'd in the Governour or <hi>Archon</hi>'s Note, for the Service of the Farm, together with ſuch Parents as have a deſire to ſee their Children, as alſo ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whom change of Air is preſcribed for their recovery.</p>
            <p>Having therefore taken leave of the <hi>Archon,</hi> whom I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Caſe of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Knives with Oriental Agate Handles em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh'd with Gold; I took the firſt <hi>Waggon,</hi> and plac'd my ſelf next to the Deputy, who drove the <hi>Waggon</hi> in a Seat covered
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:205900:70"/> over, and large enough to hold three Perſons with eaſe. The way, which is about five and twenty miles, or two hundred Furlongs, according to their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to me ſeem'd very ſhort, as well through the learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe of the Waggoner, as for the Diverſity of Objects which preſented themſelves to me in this enchanted Country. We baited at all the Country-houſes upon the Road, and were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Dancing and Muſick. There is not one navigable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in all the Country, but a great number of ſmall Streams and Brooks, of which ſome have Water enough to turn their Corn-mills and Paper-mills. They have no high Mountains, but only ſome few Hillocks, fertile in Wine and Oil, which ſet forth the Beauty of the Plains, like
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:205900:71"/> precious Stones enchas'd in Gold-ſmiths Work. The Soil yields fifteen for one, and the goodneſs of the Paſturage diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it ſelf by the excellent taſte of their meat.</p>
            <p>The Philoſopher careſs'd me with more than ordinary Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and carried me to the <hi>Foreſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> or Foreigner's Lodge, which is a Houſe built at one of the ends of the Town adjoining to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturies and Schools, where ſtrangers are entertain'd, and their Expences honourably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray'd. The firſt two days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the days of arrival and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, they feaſt very ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly; but if the Stranger ſtays any longer, he is treated as a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen: Though to ſay the truth, they are not much troubled with Strangers, for very few travel thither, for that the <hi>Europeans,</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:205900:71"/> who are the greateſt Travellers in the World, have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the place; either ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that there is nothing ſo beautiful in <hi>Tartary,</hi> or that the difficulties of travelling thither are unſurmountable. However, there was in the City when I was there, a <hi>Muſcovite</hi> of <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> two <hi>Tartars</hi> and one <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> whom meer chance had brought thither as well as my ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Reports of my Arrival being ſpread among the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, I never wanted Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which the rarity of the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent brought to viſit me. They told me that they had not ſeen in their City before ſixty years together any of the third Part of the Continent which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit, and which they only know by means of the ancient Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:205900:72"/> but one; which Perſon was a <hi>Frenchman</hi> who died three Months after his Arrival, with a Surfeit of <hi>Champignons</hi> and new Wine, which he drank to exceſs, it being then Vintage-time. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I told them, that I was likewiſe a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> which put them into a Laughter, becauſe they ſaid my Language ſpoke the contrary; for that as they ſaid, they had in their Library a Book that they found in ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a deceas'd Pilgrim, wherein they ſaw nothing that reſembl'd my ſpeech. 'Tis true, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſaid I, that in <hi>France</hi> they ſpeak otherwiſe than I do, for I underſtand the <hi>Greek</hi> which I learn'd by my own endeavours, out of a natural inclination which I had for a Language that was formerly ſpoken by the moſt excellent People in the World.</p>
            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:205900:72"/>
            <p>But of all that came to viſit me at my firſt coming, Perſons of Wit and and Learning, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> was the Perſon toward whom my Affection moſt enclin'd, as being one whoſe humour I found to be moſt agreeable with mine. Thereupon I enter'd into a ſtrict League of Friendſhip with him, ſo that whether at our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations or our Studies we never forſook each other. Which he might the more eaſily do, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that being, by reaſon of his Youth, excluded from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of publick Affairs, he was the more at leiſure. So that he was my conſtant Guide, wherever my Curioſity led me.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place he carry'd me to a Pillar built much like the Monument in <hi>London,</hi> but riſing higher, from whence I could take a full view of the City. It is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:205900:73"/> ſeated in a Plain, water'd within and without with ſeveral Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of Running Water. The Houſes are Low-built, all but the publick Buildings; which becauſe they take up a larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Ground than the private Houſes, generally over look them. But none either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or private are above two Stories high. The Figure of it is round, and it is about three good Miles in Diameter, without Walls, defended only by a ſingle Moat, which is fed by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that water it both within and without. From this high Pillar I had alſo a Proſpect of all the pleaſant Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in its moſt beautiful Trim; as alſo of the Country Houſes ſcatter'd up and down at equal diſtances, like a Fleet of Ships upon the Ocean in a Calm, or
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:205900:73"/> like ſo many Stars in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a ſerene Seaſon. About Two hundred Miles from hence, they that have a very quick ſight may diſcern a Chain of Mountains, which by reaſon of the vaſtneſs of the diſtance, ſeem to be embody'd with the Clouds themſelves.</p>
            <p>And thus having conſider'd the City in general, we deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to view it in particular. It is divided into three Quarters or Wards, of which the firſt in the heart of the City, derives its name from the Sun, the ſecond from the Council, and the third from the Schools. The Streets are wide, clean and ſtreight, like thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Trees; and inſtead of Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Kennels it is ſtor'd with Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that carry away the naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Street, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:205900:74"/> from the City. As well the <hi>Piazza's</hi> as the Streets are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with Portico's like <hi>Bolig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> as neat and elegant as the Cloiſter of the <hi>Chartrena</hi> at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.</hi> So that you may walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your Buſineſs at all Seaſons free from the annoyance of heat or rain. The Roof of theſe Portico's is ſupported by Pillars without, and Pilaſters within (I mean adjoining to the Wall it ſelf of the Houſes) of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Order,</hi> in the Council Ward; of the <hi>Ionick Order</hi> in the Schools Ward; and of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> in the Ward of the Sun. The Doors and Windows obſerve the ſame Symmetry. The tops of their Houſes are cover'd with Lead, in a Figure of a Duomo, ending with a Cuppola of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per all gilt over. The Gutters alſo being gilded are laid upon
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:205900:74"/> a Baliſter of hard Stone, between the Windows of which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Rain Water into the Rivulets underneath. Every Houſe has a Garden belonging to it on the back ſide, with a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, cauſing a delicate Proſpect at the Entrance. And both the Streets and Portico's are ſo order'd, that the back ſides of the Houſes face each other the Gardens lying between, only parted by a Rail, from on both ſides there is a continual fall of clear Water from the Mouth of ſome Antick Figure or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>In the middle of the Piazza of the Suns Ward, which is Six hundred Paces in Diameter, there ſtands a Structure like the <hi>Pantheon</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that it is ſurrounded with a Portico, ſupported with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:205900:75"/> of Porphyry, the Chapter and Baſes of which are gilt. There are four entrances into it at four oppoſite Doors fronting the four Cardinal Points; and the coming to it is through as many Gutters leading to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the Grand Portico of the Piazza. The Roof opens in the middle, as well to give light to that Pompous Encloſure, as to give vent to the Perfumes that are burnt therein. In the Body of the Wall under that part where the Roof begins to riſe, are Three hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty round holes, anſwering to the Three hundred and ſixty degrees of the Ecliptick, to mark out the Point of the Zodiack which the Sun touches every day above the Earth, which according to their Opinion moves and not the Sun, whom they will have
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:205900:75"/> to be fix'd to the Center of the World. This vaſt <hi>Cupola</hi> is rear'd up into the Air with a double row of Alabaſter Pillars, of the Order of the <hi>Caryatides;</hi> the workmanſhip moſt delicate, the Drapery of Gold, and the Baſe of the ſame, upon a Pedeſtal of Jaſper. The Frize enrich'd with <hi>Releifs</hi> of Gold, having its <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niche</hi> alſo of Alabaſter, is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted with a Baliſter of the ſame Metal. The Counter Pila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the <hi>Corridore</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the beauty of the Columns, their hollow ſpaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fill'd up with Serpentine, as is the whole Concavity of the Duomo with <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> the moſt beautiful that ever I ſaw in the moſt curious Cabinets in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> From the Center of the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is of Alabaſter as white as Snow, riſe three
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:205900:76"/> round Steps of Steel, adorn'd with Arabick Figures of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> alſo of Gold, which frame the Baſe of a <hi>Tripos</hi> all of maſſy Gold, enchas'd with precious Stones, of which the upper moſt Figure, like an Eagles Head, bears a little Perfumer of Gold likewiſe, to which Rubies and Diamonds contribute ſuch a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre, as dazles the Eyes of the Beholder. The uppermoſt of the Steps publiſhes alſo the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Perſon, that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo rich a Jewel to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, by this Inſcription in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Gold, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>The Gift of</hi> Choſores <hi>King of the Perſians.</hi> The Circle of Gold that ſurrounds the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture of the <hi>Duomo,</hi> ſpreads his Beams of the ſame Metal upon the lead that covers it without.</p>
            <p>Aſtoniſh'd at ſo much Riches,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:205900:76"/> I could hardly believe my own Eyes. But my Guide gave me to underſtand that the Quarries that afforded the Marble which adorn'd this ſumptuous Temple, were not far diſtant. And then conſidering with my ſelf, that that ſame Luxury which ruins larger and more Potent States than this, was baniſh'd hence, I began to think, that in ſo many Ages they might have probably heap'd together ſo much Gold as I ſaw.</p>
            <p>From thence I went to the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azza of the Schools, where ſtands a Fountain adorn'd with a larger Aigret than both thoſe together in the <hi>Vatican:</hi> And the fall of the Water like Dew, is ſo artfully contriv'd, that the Beams of the Sun continually form in the driſling Rain the Daughter of <hi>Thaumantes.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:205900:77"/>
            <p>The Piazza of the Council Ward was adorn'd with a more Magnificent Fountain repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Celeſtial Sphear, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Column of Granate Stone; ſo conformable to the Syſteme of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think that ſome of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers had communicated his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to theſe Philoſophers; but they told me that the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine had taken Root in their Schools above a thouſand years before; and that as for <hi>Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> they had never ſo much as heard of his Name. The Globe of the Sun, which makes the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from all the Points of its Convexity, caſts an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of watry Beams, with which it beſprinkles the Earth; the Moon, withal the reſt of the Planets, and all the Parts of the Spherical Concavity, whence the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:205900:77"/> ſame Beams deſcend like Rain into a Receptacle faſhion'd like a Roman S or <hi>Oget</hi> in Architecture, made of a Stone ſo hard that they were twelve years before they could hollow and poliſh it.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Piazza</hi> live the Thirty, who aſſemble every Morning in the hall of the Grand Palace, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do Juſtice to particular Perſons, or to conſult about the publick Affairs. If the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent be indiſpos'd, the moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient next to him preſides; and they Summon the Senior of the Two hunder'd and ſeventy to ſupply the number of the Thirty.</p>
            <p>There are neither Proctors nor Notaries, nor Advocates to be ſeen in this Place, every one Pleads for himſelf. But if they find the Perſon to be uncapable to Plead for himſelf, he has li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to bring a Philoſopher,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:205900:78"/> who is his Friend, who does him that kindneſs gratis. I often frequented their Courts through pleaſure, which I took in hearing the Polite Orations which are there ſpoken. For the ſtream of diſcourſe is not interrupted with the irkſom Citation of Law Caſes, with which our Advocates ſtuff their Pleadings: They ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other Law to ſtudy but that of Nature, inſtead of the Volums of <hi>Codes</hi> and <hi>Digeſts,</hi> they read themſelves, and draw from their proper Fund the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments by which they maintain the Right of their Cauſe, yet not without the flouriſhes and beauties of true Reaſoning nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Among the reſt I was preſent at the Oration of a young Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher upon a Fact, which merits the Relation by reaſon of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy of the Caſe.</p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:205900:78"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Philaretes</hi> (for that was the young Philoſophers Name) had made his own Caravan in the ſame Country Houſe with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania,</hi> whoſe rare Beauty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with her ſweet and obliging humour had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him her abſolute Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. But he was not her only Admirer, for he had a Rival whoſe Name was <hi>Philip;</hi> and the ſtrife was between theſe two who ſhould gain this Incomparable fair one by the Aſſiduity of their Services, or who ſhould give her the moſt undenyable Marks of his Paſſion. One day <hi>Philaretes</hi> being in the Fields, a Fire took hold of a Barn through which there was a neceſſity to paſs to the Chamber where <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania</hi> was crying out for help. Preſently <hi>Philip</hi> ran to her aſſiſtance, dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the Flames, which a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:205900:79"/> Fire more ſcorching, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, would not ſuffer him to be ſenſible of. So ſoon as he was got to his Beloved, he threw off the reſt of his Cloaths which he had ſav'd from the Flames by his ſwiftneſs, and of them makes a long Twiſt, which he girt about her waſte, and ſo letting her down through the Window threw himſelf after her. After that he lookt upon her as the purchaſe of his Merit; nor did ſhe her ſelf ſcruple to declare her ſelf in favour of him who had ſo generouſly expos'd himſelf to ſave her Life. <hi>Philaretes</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ceas'd not to continue his Courtſhip, extenuating the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry of his, and ſtill ſpeaking ſlightly of the danger to which he had expos'd himſelf for her ſake.</p>
            <p>Some time after <hi>Philip</hi> put two
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:205900:79"/> young Colts into his Chariot on purpoſe to try them before <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> to whom a Companion of hers being gain'd before hand by her Lover, made a propoſal to get up into his Chariot and take the Air for a Mile or two, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging her ſelf that care ſhould be taken of the Sheep till their return. But they had not rid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four Furlongs, before the Colts, being frighted at the ſhade of an Oak, fell a running with ſuch a fury, that all the Skill of their Driver could not ſtop them, ſo that <hi>Philip</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to leap out of his ſeat to take hold of the Reins, but he was too feeble to be their Maſter: inſomuch that now obedient to nothing but the Impetuoſity of their fury, they had already whirl'd the miſerable <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania</hi> within ten Paces of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:205900:80"/> Precipice, which <hi>Philaretes</hi> perceiving, ſcotch'd the Wheel of the Wagon ſo luckily, that he had time to get before, and with his own Body to prevent the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Animals from running any farther. By that means he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd his Miſtreſs from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but it coſt him the loſs of his right Leg, which was ſo broke and maſh'd, that there was no cure for it, but by the Amputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Member. That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Maim, which ſtill pleaded in behalf of <hi>Philaretes,</hi> oblig'd her to give him the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in merit, yet ſhe knew not how to reſolve to withdraw her heart from <hi>Philip,</hi> to beſtow it upon a Mutilated Lover. At length after the Services per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, they return'd all three to the City, where <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania</hi> being preſs'd by her Parents, declar'd
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:205900:80"/> in favour of <hi>Philip.</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Philaretes</hi> underſtanding her reſolution, took upon him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reſolution, that is to dye. Now though by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which only takes place in this ſmall Territory, a Man might lay violent hands upon himſelf without a Crime, however who does it without conſent of the Council, is lookt upon as an uncivil Companion that would take a Journey without taking leave of his Friends; and therefore there is a Decree, that his Body ſhall be carry'd forth of the Territories of the State, as a Fugitive adjudg'd unworthy of burial. Thereupon the Diſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lover to avoid the ſcandal and Affront, requeſted leave to make himſelf away in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords, if there be no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:205900:81"/> within this venerable Aſſembly that has experimented the Rigours to which I am reduc'd by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of my Love, it will ſignifie nothing for me to ſpeak, ſince I have nothing to hope from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my Judges. It behoves me to be a perſon that has loved with the ſame Paſſion, which still I have for the fair</hi> Urania, <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her Refuſal of me, to be in a capacity to do reaſon to the Juſtice of my demand. But if there be not any Perſon here, as probably it is ſo well experienc'd, the Torments which I ſuffer being too violent to continue to that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Old Age that adorns thoſe Seats of Judicature, I hope that Reaſon will ſupply the defect of an Experience which your Wiſdom was too great at any time to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo. The loſs of ſo principal a Member had been a pretence ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:205900:81"/> enough for me to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded your Permiſſion to die; and I had done it before now, had not my hopes of poſſeſſing</hi> Urania <hi>moderated in ſome meaſure the bitter Woes of my languiſhing life, after that only Bleſſing has failed me, that could create within me a deſire to ſave it. Now then ſince her Reſolution has condemned me to Miſeries that ne're will end, and that by this condemnation I find my ſelf a burthen to my ſelf, troubleſome to my Parents, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to the World, and unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the State, I have bethought my ſelf, that there is no other way to ſhun this perpetual and cruel Torment, but by the only way that Nature puts into our Hands. You grant it to a poor decrepit old Creature, with the ſame Freedom as you permit the pulling down of a Houſe when it is ready to fall.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:205900:82"/> Nor do you refuſe the ſame leave to young Paralyticks, nor to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is ſeiz'd with an incurable Distemper. Seeing then my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is ſuch that nothing but death can cure, it is not reaſonable that you ſhould deny it me, ſeeing my Condition is worſe than that of the most miſerable. Now if my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune will not prevail to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to do me juſtice, I beg your Permiſſion as a Favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Novelty of a Cauſe, for which there had not been a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in any Age before, ſo ſtrangely ſurpriz'd the Judges, that they had never agreed in favour of the Suppliant, but that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> aſſured them, That he had juſt ſuch another deſign in his Youth, from which nothing could have diverted him but the change of a better Fortune, and that moſt certainly it was a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:205900:82"/> great piece of Cruelty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain a perſon to live whether he would or no, in torments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to any but himſelf that endures them. So that his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion having brought over thoſe that diſſented before, the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent pronounced ſentence in this manner.</p>
            <p>Philaretes, <hi>the Senate gives you leave to depart the World; you may do it when you pleaſe, and after what manner you think fit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania</hi> being inform'd of the matter, came to the Senate to prevent him; for her heart could no longer reſiſt the ſenſible At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacques of a Paſſion ſo tender. After Sentence pronounced, ſhe met him coming out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate-houſe, to whom <hi>Philaretes,</hi> preventing her, <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>my Goddeſs, the Victim which my Love offers to your Divinity!
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:205900:83"/> How!</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>have they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd the Sentence of my Death? For your Death will infallibly be mine. No,</hi> replied <hi>Philaretes, I am going to die, that you may live and enjoy your fill of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Content.</hi> At thoſe words ſhe ſeemed to be in a Trance; from whence recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf, ſhe accompanied her Martyr to his Lodging, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to ſurceaſe the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Decree for ſome days: Which he did, in regard his Affection had rendred him a perfect Slave to her Will. All that time ſhe ſpent in perſwading him to live, with an abſolute Promiſe to marry him. But it was impoſſible, out of an Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that the Senate would take him for a meer Deluder and a <hi>Braggadochio. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing him unflexible, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:205900:83"/> to follow his Example, no leſs tormented than her Lover; and the better to bring her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to paſs, ſhe requeſted him only to marry her before he died; to which, not knowing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign that lay conceal'd in her Breaſt, he readily conſented. Thereupon they were married in due form, with the mutual Conſent of their Parents, who kept the Nuptial Feaſts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Cuſtome. At the end of which, <hi>Philaretes</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf privately from his Father-in-law's Houſe to go and kill himſelf in his own, without the knowledge of his Wife. But he could not deceive her, for ſhe was ſoon at his Heels, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ready to ſwallow a large Quantity of <hi>Opium,</hi> which his Mother had brought him in a Gold Cup; <hi>Since,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:205900:84"/> can by no means engage you to live with me, neceſſity obliges me to end my days together with you.</hi> And ſo ſaying, ſhe deſir'd her own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had follow'd her, to prepare her a Cup of the ſame Beverage, which could not be refus'd her, ſince the Cuſtom of the Country permits that ſuch Wives who will may follow their Husbands in death. Thereupon the two Mothers paid that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Office to their Children with thoſe ſad Sentiments which are natural to Women upon ſuch Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. They drank both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and then embracing each other, after a thouſand tender kiſſes, they both fell into a ſweet ſlumber, never more to wake. Their Bodies were both burnt in the ſame Funeral Pile, and their Aſhes being mix'd together, were thrown upon the ſame Bed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:205900:84"/> of Earth, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of their Funerals. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to preſerve the Memory of ſo rare an Action, they caus'd to be engrav'd upon a Marble Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument againſt the Garden Wall two Rings one within another, in the midſt of a flaming fire, with this Motto <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, <hi>That neither Death it ſelf could part them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Wards are ſubdivided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Tribes; the Council Ward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Twelve, the Suns Ward into Thirteen, and the Schools Ward into five only, becauſe the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and Manufactures take up the greateſt part of it. The Council of <hi>Thirty</hi> alſo deputes Three out of the Two hunder'd and ſeventy to govern every Tribe; of which the one takes care of the Concerns within, the other without; that is to ſay, of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:205900:85"/> the Farms belonging to his Tribe, and the Third is ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant over the Magazines; for every Tribe hath its particular Magazines, to which the private People repair every day to fetch their neceſſary Proviſions. There is nothing of ſervitude among them, for they are all their own Servants, only when they grow old they are waited upon by their Children, who upon their returns from performing their Duties in the Farms, or other Places, retire to their Parents whom they Honour and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as long as they live.</p>
            <p>The Schools are their Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Vertue, Sciences and Arts, as well Military as Civil, where their Children are educated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der excellent Maſters, who the firſt year trie the Diſpoſition and Genius of their Scholars, and if
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:205900:85"/> they find any one uncapable of learning, they inform the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant, who ſends him to the Manufactures with leave to make choice of what Trade he pleaſes, which he is taught by Maſters made choice of by the Council of Thirty: And under theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters it is that they follow their ſeveral Callings, in ſeveral Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Building, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their pains upon all things either neceſſary or ſeemly for the uſe of human Life, and their Labours are afterwards diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Magazines for the common Service of the People.</p>
            <p>The firſt things taught in theſe Schools are the Mathematicks, of which they learn all the Parts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Aſtronomy, wherein they excel: For as for Aſtrology they reject it as a frivolous thing. And indeed I could wiſh that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:205900:86"/> ſuch as waſte their Time in that Study, or make it their buſineſs to conſult our Aſtrologers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their future Deſtinies, and all ſuch who ſhall read theſe Travels had the ſame ſcorn and contempt of Aſtrology which this wiſe People, by me ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately diſcover'd, have. Give me leave therefore to ſay this by the by, for the Edification of my Reader, ſince ſo fair an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity preſents it ſelf, that I my ſelf formerly ſtudy'd this Art, and had made ſo fair a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the knowledge of Schemes and Horoſcopes, that I began to be in high Requeſt; but more the ſucceſs which my Maſter had who taught me at <hi>Rome,</hi> who was Aſtrologer to Queen <hi>Chriſtina.</hi> However the better to aſſure my ſelf of the ſolidity of this Art, I was reſolv'd
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:205900:86"/> to ſurprize him: To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, one Morning I preſented him the Figure of my Nativity, which I had been calculating all night long, accompany'd with his own Directions. Very true it is, that he knew of himſelf that it was mine; but then the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Saturn to my Aſcendant in the third Degree, which is my third Year, he made a doubt of it, not believing that I had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped ſo fatal a direction. Thereupon requeſting him to tell me what it was, <hi>A Shipwrack,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>wherein I ſhould abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſh.</hi> This anſwer, more convincing to me than that of <hi>Thraſibulus</hi> to <hi>Tiberius</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> made me ſtand in Admiration. Afterwards ſearching by what means I might avoid the danger, he obſerv'd that Venus came to my aſſiſtance,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:205900:87"/> by correcting the Malignity of Saturn. This lucky Accident ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving encourag'd me to make a farther Progreſs in a Study, whereby I thought to have rais'd my ſelf above Humanity, I fell to it ſeriouſly, and ſpent ſix Months in the examination of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> till I came to that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, where he ſays, That they whoſe <hi>Horoſcope</hi> or <hi>Aſcendant</hi> the Leg of <hi>Capricorn</hi> governs, ſhould be troubl'd with Diſeaſes in the Legs; which is one of the grand Maxims held at this day by the Aſtrologers, as are all the reſt of this great Maſter in their Art. But then ſaid I to my ſelf 'tis not the immoveable Point or ſpace of the Heavens which influences, but rather the Conſtellation which is there plac'd, of which the Leg makes a part, and from whence that twelfth Part of the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:205900:87"/> 
               <hi>Zodiack</hi> deriv'd its name, in the time of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> above ſeventeen Ages ago. Now every Age the Stars of the Figure advancing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree from the Eaſt to the Weſt, they ought to have recoil'd as much. Nevertheleſs our Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at preſent call thoſe Parts or Spaces by the ſame name, and ground their Predictions thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if the Figure were ſtill fix'd in the ſame place. Beſides ſuppoſing that the Leg of <hi>Capricorn</hi> had not chang'd place, who does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that this Maxim was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Relation of one Limb to another purely Imaginary, there being nothing of Reality in any of theſe Figures; ſo that the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Art appearing to me ſo vain, I took a diſliking to the Science it ſelf. Many other Reaſons alſo ſo cleanly convinc'd me of the falſity of it, that at length I quite
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:205900:88"/> and clean abandon'd it. Seeing that if the Aſtrologer lit upon a paſt Accident for once, I attribute it, as the Learned Perſons of this Country of the Sun do, meerly to Chance, which ſometimes may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Truth among thouſands of Lyes.</p>
            <p>From the Mathematicks they paſs to Grammar learning, withal at the ſame time to write and ſpeak well; and among all the other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alects the <hi>Attic</hi> there prevailes, in regard that they have not had any Commerce with Foreign Nations, whence proceeds the Corruption of Languages; whereby it comes to paſs, that they have preſerv'd the purity of their own, as have alſo ſome Villages of <hi>Greece</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> where they ſpeak the pure litteral Greek; for that living at a diſtance from the Sea, and in a Country of difficult acceſs, they
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:205900:88"/> enjoy the ſame good Fortune. For which, beſides the Teſtimony of <hi>Davity,</hi> I have alſo the Authority of the Reverend and Learned <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, Michael</hi> of <hi>Epirus,</hi> who but lately aſſur'd me at <hi>Venice,</hi> that he had met with ſuch in his Travels.</p>
            <p>By this time their Judgments being rightly inform'd, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more fit to read Philoſophy, which they learn in the laſt place. They have alſo their bodily Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, being taught at the ſame time to handle their Arms both Rapier and Back-ſword, to ſhoot with their Bows, and to ride the manag'd Horſe, in a place appointed for that purpoſe, where alſo are admitted the Manufacture Apprentices. They never teach Logick nor Rhetorick; alledging that thoſe two Sciences are as natural to a Man as to goe, or to make uſe of his Hands; and that no man can arrive to be an
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:205900:89"/> exquiſite Logician, or a perfect Orator that has not an excelling Genius that way. However they give their Scholars certain general Precepts, very much agreeing with the Maxims of the <hi>Epicureans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They alſo read and expound in their Schools <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Epicurus, Democritus, Thales, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes,</hi> and all the ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, of which we have only the Names; and whoſe writings they preſerve; leaving to their Scholars to chooſe what Opinion they think moſt probable. They alſo permit them to read the Poets, though very much incens'd againſt them, for their Invention of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles concerning Deities that never were. For by the Converſe which I had among them I found that their knowledge in Philoſophy was altogether bounded by Sence, which they take for the only Rule
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:205900:89"/> of their Reaſoning, the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of which are to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and corrected by themſelves, being perſwaded that what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be apprehended by the Sence, is not at all, nor can be the object of our Meditations. To which when I anſwer'd that the contrary was taught in our Schools, that is to ſay that Reaſon corrected the Sence, they lookt upon it as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, as if a Blind man ſhould go about to correct his Guide.</p>
            <p>They generally believe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of the firſt matter, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to conceive how any thing ſhould be made out of nothing; that the World with all its varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties was produc'd by the ſympathy and antipathy of the firſt Body's, which as they had no beginning will have no ending. They make ſome Bodies moveable of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; others by the impulſe of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:205900:90"/> thoſe only in a void ſpace. They acknowledge no other Cauſe but one, which is the Material. For all which Opinions of theirs I do not here produce their ſeveral Reaſons, as deſigning at preſent only a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Relation; which elſe would require a larger Volume by it ſelf, which perhaps I may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after put to publick view.</p>
            <p>If any one begin to broach new Opinions they cite him before the Council, who examine them, and if they find them ill grounded, the Perſon is not commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, but only to hold his Peace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Penalty of being put into the number of the <hi>Scandalous;</hi> a Liſt of whoſe names is affix'd to the Door of the Temple, there to remain to perpetuity: an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which next to exile, they ſtand moſt in fear of.</p>
            <p>Their Library more ſpacious than
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:205900:90"/> the <hi>Vatican,</hi> is ſo much the more Curious, by how much it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with an infinite number of Authors, of which we know not ſo much as the Names, and ſuch as liv'd before <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Thoſe they call the ancient Authors; for the Modern they eſteem to be thoſe that wrote after their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is above Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ago. They ſhew'd me alſo Tranſlations of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Books, which make the World to be much more ancient than we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be; our Chronology being no more than a Great Grand Child of theirs.</p>
            <p>As for Printing tho' they well know what it is, yet they make no uſe of it; ſo that all their Books are in Munuſcript, either in Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Paper, in the Greek Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in regard they know no other; unleſs it be the <hi>Tartarian,</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:205900:91"/> which by what means ſome of them come to underſtand I ſhall relate in due place.</p>
            <p>They diſtinguiſh their Books ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Quality of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And if any Author of their own writes any thing new, his Book is not admitted into this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Society of Volums, till it has had the Approbation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Thirty: Private Men may have it before, but few care for it till then; ſo great a veneration they have for the Judgment of that moſt noble Aſſembly, all compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of learned and choſen Men, the flowre of Philoſophers, as are alſo the two hunder'd and ſeventy.</p>
            <p>Among the Legiſlators, I ſaw the Pentateuch of <hi>Moſes,</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated by the care of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ſent to his Maſter <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as ſome Lines under his own hand, at the end of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:205900:91"/> I ask'd them their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning that Law; to which they anſwer'd that they had a great eſteem for the Moral part, diſlik'd his Sacrifices, condemn'd his Ceremonies, and for his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical part, ſome they deem'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, the reſt very improbable: One of the Company added that he was a Philoſopher, that he had too enigmatically deſcrib'd the Generation of the World, and of the Creatures therein to a blockiſh ſort of People, uncapable to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it by methodical Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: That he believ'd with <hi>Moſes,</hi> that man was produc'd out of the Earth, and that without doubt he had borrow'd that Opinion from the learning of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom he confeſſes himſelf to have had his Education.</p>
            <p>At length I came to the Book which was left by the <hi>French</hi> man
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:205900:92"/> of whom I have already made mention. They kept it apart, not knowing where to range it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not underſtand it: I found it to be a New Teſtament. Whereupon they earneſtly requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to tranſlate it for them, if I thought it worth my while. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I pull'd out a Greek Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament out of my Pocket, that had been my <hi>Vade Mecum</hi> in all my Travels, and by way of prevention, inſtead of a Tranſlation, ſaid I, here is the Original, which you may read at your leiſure, becauſe I do here preſent it to your Library. At which they were overjoy'd, and gave me a thouſand Thanks. After which they led me into the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where all their Curioſities were kept; and there I beheld a Collection of all that ever the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of Nature produc'd, or ever was invented by Art. Among the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:205900:92"/> reſt I ſaw ſeveral Caſes of Letters with all the furniture belonging to a Printing-Houſe; ſeveral ſorts of Fire arms, of which they prais'd the Invention, but condemn'd the uſe as treacherous and cruel; <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robolick</hi> Mirrours, that caſt forth Fire in a moment; a flying Engin; Proſpective Glaſſes, by which I could diſtinguiſh in the Moon Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, Valleys, Medows, Forreſts, and if not Animals, at leaſt ſome ſmall moving Machines. They alſo ſhew'd me in the ſame place, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, half men, half beaſts, of I know not what kind, preſerv'd in Chryſtals fill'd with Spirit of Wine. Microſcopes, ſhewing all the Vital Parts of a Hand-worm, and of all thoſe little Inſects flying in the Air, which the moſt piercing Eye could hardly diſcern without the aſſiſtance of theſe Glaſſes: Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Watches and Clocks, of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:205900:93"/> which they make no uſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them ſuperfluous, in regard that being ſo expert as they are in Aſtronomy, they can tell what hour it is either by day or night; for that the Air is not there much ſubject to be overcaſt. As for their Climate their own Aſtronomical Obſervations reckon it two and forty Degrees, far from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial Line; and their own Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian is the firſt in their own Maps.</p>
            <p>Now tho' they inhabit a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try abounding in all things that may render Life agreeable and commodious, yet they live after a moſt ſparing and auſtere manner. For they affect not the delicious taſtes of Drink or coſtly Viands, unleſs when they are ſick, or make great Banquets, which they never do but only upon certain Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that very rarely, as at Weddings, the Birth of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:205900:93"/> Receptions of Strangers or the like, without being thereto conſtrain'd, however by any Laws or Decrees. They eat about ſome three hours after they riſe in a Morning; but their chief Meals are in the Evening about three hours before they go to bed. Their Magazins furniſh them with courſe Food, Bread and Wine; but for Veniſon and Fiſh they eat none, but what they hunt and catch themſelves, or what their Children ſend them from their Country Houſes.</p>
            <p>Their Habit is plain, made of Wooll dy'd of a Violet Colour for the Men, and white for the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; which is the only diſtinction of their two Sexes. As to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, it is the ſame us'd all along by the Ancients, with a Stole up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Shoulders after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to cover them
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:205900:94"/> in the Country from the Sun, or when they are forc'd to go in the Rain. As to other things, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed and bare footed, only in a Leather Sandal lin'd within ſide with Wooll. They that have Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els may wear them; and as for the three hunder'd they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by their Scarlet habit, which none beſides are allow'd to wear.</p>
            <p>There are no profeſs'd Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans among them, for they all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Phyſick. 'Tis very true that in difficult Caſes they call a Philoſopher, who comes upon the ſame Conditions as their Pleaders without any Fee: Their uſual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies they take from Trees, Herbs and Roots growing in their own Grounds, which have the ſame Qualities, with Caſſia, Senna, and Scammony, and with which they ſuddenly cure all Diſtempers that are curable. For in regard
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:205900:94"/> that Noble Science is there pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd for no advantage of gain, the Philoſopher who is ſent for never ſeeks to prolong the Cure; beſides that making up their Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions themſelves, they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear on the Apothecaries part, whoſe Avarice or <hi>qui pro quo</hi> often times does the Patient more injury than the Diſtemper it ſelf. There is not a Surgeon nor a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be ſeen, for they never let blood, as not being to be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they ought to wound a Patient to cure him; or that the Blood which is the ſeat of the Soul, with which it has ſo ſtrict an Alliance, that it ſeems to be inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable, ought to be ſpilt to make it better, ſeeing that which remains in the Body is as bad as before the Blood letting; but that it is better corrected by <hi>Catharticks,</hi> which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from its Maſs the Humours
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:205900:95"/> which infect it, without taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that which is good, and that the quantity of it may be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd at any time by Diet, Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and Sweating.</p>
            <p>As to Wounds and Bruiſes, they proceed after the ſame method as in Fevers; that is to ſay, they cure themſelves with the aſſiſtance of a Philoſopher if need require.</p>
            <p>The Women ſhave and trim their Husbands, of whom they are ſo jealous, that they will not ſuffer any bodies hands to come neer their Faces but their own.</p>
            <p>The Philoſophers have alſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific Remedies for the Diſeaſes of the Soul, the continual uſe of which fortifies the Memory and purifies the Wit in ſuch a manner, that they will make a Dunce Ingenious. It is a Compoſition of which we have the ingredients in this part of the World; and of which I have
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:205900:95"/> often made uſe ſince my return into Europe, with good ſucceſs as well to my ſelf as to others. You ſee there none that are troubl'd with the Gout, in regard they are both ſober, temperate, and active; beſides that the Continence of the two Sexes is ſo great, that there is no harbour there for that ſame Diſeaſe which the <hi>Italians</hi> call the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a ſick Perſon be given over as paſt recovery, there is no need of a Comforter, becauſe they do not conceive there is any evil in death, which they look upon as only a meer Ceſſation from Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Thought, which may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly return one day, if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles from whence the ſame Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Thought deriv'd their firſt beginning ſhould happen to reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. The Children burn the Body of their Parents deceas'd in their
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:205900:96"/> own Gardens, and ſcatter their Aſhes upon the Earth; believing that the enlivening Atoms are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioted up in the Flames to their firſt Original, which they believe to be the Sun; and by their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Aſhes with the Earth, they believe that in eating the Plants which proceed from thence, that they enliven the more groſs and terreſtrial Portion of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. To ſpeak the truth, I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the goodneſs of the Air which they breath in thoſe Parts, partly to this Cuſtom, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it ſo free from thoſe Infections which the ſtinking Exhalations of the Bodies interr'd in our Cities are the certain cauſe of among us.</p>
            <p>In regard their Commerce is not great, 'tis not very poſſible ſhould be Rich. However they are not poor neither; for that the fertility of the Soil furniſhes them with all
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:205900:96"/> things neceſſary for the ſupport and pleaſure of Life, and to ſpare. So that they ſend the ſuperfluity of their Proviſions and Manufactures once a year to a Fair that is held between the Confines of this State, and the <hi>Great Moguls</hi> Country, where they Barter their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities for Pearls, Diamonds, and other Precious Stones, or elſe for Gold and Silver coyn'd, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Publick Treaſure, which ſurpaſſes in value thoſe of St. <hi>Denis, Loretto</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> put them altogether tho' they be the Richeſt that I have ſeen in Europe. Nor do they prohibit private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from ſending their Goods thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Trading upon their own accounts. For after they are out of their times, and have done that Service which is requir'd from them for the Benefit of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Farms, or otherwiſe, till they
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:205900:97"/> come to be Thirty years of Age, they have then liberty to work at home, for the Ornament of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Houſes. Beſides, that whatever they do for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Commonwealth is ſure to be publickly rewarded; and with this wealth, either purchas'd by their Induſtry or their Vertue, they feaſt and give Portions to their Children when they marry them.</p>
            <p>Now altho' they lye ſurrounded by the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> yet are they not at War with any body: For the Great <hi>Kam,</hi> who has always had a high eſteem for them, by reaſon of their Integrity, permits them to live in Peace and Tranquillity one among another. In acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of which favour, they furniſh him at all times with a ſmall Regiment of 300. Men, under Thirty years of Age, who go to ſerve him voluntarily, and all the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:205900:97"/> time that they ſtay there, is lookt upon as if they had ſpent it in the Service of the State. Theſe 300 chooſe themſelves their own Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, who ſwears fidelity to the Great <hi>Kam;</hi> who at his firſt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val preſents him with very fair Arms and Weapons, and gives him leave to make choice of ſix Leiutenants, to Command every one under him Fifty Men a peice. Nor do they ever return from his Service without a conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and they that ſignalize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by any extraordinary At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement, are rewarded moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver according to their Merit. Thus it is that they come to underſtand the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Language, of which the People of this Country make uſe in their Commerce by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of one or two of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, who are deputed by the Council to attend the Fair.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:205900:98"/> When they are ready to March to the Great <hi>Kam,</hi> the Council gives them an Order to take Arms out of the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways furniſh'd to Arm Sixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men upon occaſion. Their Offenſive Arms are a Bow, a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitar, a Mace of Iron, a Javelin, and a Pike; their Defenſive only a Buckler and a Helmet.</p>
            <p>All the while that I convers'd with them I could not find that they had any Notion of God after our manner; in regard that as I have ſaid, their Philoſophy ſolely depends upon Sence. As for thoſe Deities which either Poetry, Fear, or Imagination has ſet up, they are too wiſe to acknowledg; ſo that I have nothing to ſay concerning their Religion, except you call Religion that which they believe and practiſe concerning the Sun.</p>
            <p>For they unanimouſly hold that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:205900:98"/> Planet to be the moſt Lovely, the moſt Powerful, and the moſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent of all the Beings. They are perſwaded that it is the Soul of the World, and that the Beams of the Sun being incorporated into the Creatures give motion to their Corporeal Maſs, the external Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of which makes the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal difference which we ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Tho' they do not deny but that their different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Operations may proceed as well from the variety of little Bodies, with which they are mix'd, as from the Beams of the Sun more or leſs purify'd. They aſſert the Sun to be a Globe of Fire exactly rarify'd, and ſhining in the Center of the World, as being the heart which animates all the Parts of it; and the Element or Principle of Souls to which they all return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſeperation from the Body,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:205900:99"/> as the Water returns to the Sea, diſcharging it ſelf from the Land. Every tenth day of the year they go to the Temple to be there when the Sun Riſes; and as ſoon as the Sun appears through one of thoſe holes which mark out the Degrees of the <hi>Eccliptick,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:205900:101"/> the Concourſe of the adjoining Rivulets.</p>
            <p>From the Principal Outlets of the City, you walk to the Confines of their Country Houſes, under the Shade of long Rows of Elms planted in a ſtreight Line, which affords the pleaſure alſo of a fair Proſpect, to thoſe that promenade through the Chief Streets, at the end of every one of which there ſtands a Portal all of coſtly Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, which at night are only barr'd with a ſingle Draw-bridge about the height of a Man, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made rather to terminate the ſight than for any defenee. For the City has no more than one ſingle Moat of running Water, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the entrance of Wild Beaſts, (which rarely happens) nevertheleſs they do adventure ſo far, by reaſon they are continually hunted by the Youth of the Country that are put
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:205900:101"/> to manure the Land. Beſides that they breed up great Maſtiff Dogs ſo ſtrong and ſo couragious, that they will encounter with ſucceſs the moſt Savage of Wild Beaſts, againſt which they only exerciſe their fierceneſs, being no leſs tame in the Company of Men, whoſe Guardians they ſeem to be, taking their Rounds day and night about the Fields, with their Iron Collers ſtuck with ſharp Nails. When the Hunters take a Lyon, or any ſuch dangerous and miſcheivous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they nail him to a Tree at the Avenues into the Territories, as formerly the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Walls. And indeed the ſmall number of thoſe Wild Beaſts which is to be found in a Country whither the numerous Herds and Flocks of Cattle are ſufficient Baits to entice them, ſhews them to be terrify'd by ſuch Executions.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:205900:102"/> Their Tillage and rural Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons take their beginning at about a Mile diſtance from the City Moat, all the Delightful ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween being allotted for publick Recreation.</p>
            <p>Their year which begins juſt at the Winter Solſtice, is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſix and thirty <hi>Decads</hi> of days, and ſo they count the firſt, ſecond, &amp;c. day of every <hi>Decad;</hi> and the time which remains till the Point of Revolution, they call the <hi>Surpluſage;</hi> and paſs it altogether as they do the tenth day of every <hi>Decad.</hi> By which means they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Fopperies and Trifles of <hi>Biſſextiles</hi> and <hi>Epacts,</hi> which the moſt cautious corrections of our Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenders cannot free from miſtakes.</p>
            <p>They begin their <hi>Epochs</hi> from the Solſtice next enſuing the Inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Miſargyrus,</hi> and adjuſt their Chronology by his Succeſſors,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:205900:102"/> whoſe Portraitures to the Life they preſerve in their Treaſury, to the number of One hunder'd and fourſcore, till the time of <hi>Philopoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> their Chief Preſident at the time when I was there. And this is all the Chief recompence of their Supream Preſidents for all their care and pains in the Government of the State; the Publick Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes two fair Medals of his Face to be caſt in Gold, of which the one is laid up in the Treaſury, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is beſtow'd upon the Perſon himſelf, who leaves it to his Family at his death, as a Mark of Honour to encourage his Poſterity to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Steps. In a word, for a Concluſion of all that can be ſaid touching the Manners and Cuſtoms of theſe People, I muſt needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that they are ſo regular and juſt, that the Age of Gold may ſeem to continue ſtill among them
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:205900:103"/> They mutually aſſiſt each other in all their Affairs, and love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to that Degree, that you would take them all for Brethren.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore having taken a view of all that was to be ſeen in this admirable City, I ſpent the beſt part of my Time with <hi>Eugenes,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Schools, or in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary; where I was preſent at their Readings and Diſputes. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the leſſer Apartments appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their youth, there is one large Hall where the marry'd Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of both Sexes meet every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening, to hear the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Phyſick and Morality which the Philoſophers there make in their ſeveral Turns; and where they take all the Liberty which our Preachers aſſume to reprehend Vice. Their Diſputes contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Pedantick, there is not to be heard <hi>I deny your Major,</hi> or <hi>I
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:205900:103"/> prove my Minor.</hi> The Head of the School propounds a <hi>Theſis,</hi> which a Schollar undertaking maintains with the beſt Arguments he can produce, and is then oppos'd by another; after which three Philoſophers give their judgment who has done beſt.</p>
            <p>As to their Ponunciation it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with that of our Criticks; in which they differ from our <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Greeks; and I made it my Buſineſs alſo to turn over the Books of ſeveral Ancient Philoſophers, which we want, the ſuppreſſion of which, though falſly, is laid to the charge of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Ambition. By the reading of which I found the Modeſty of thoſe Great Men, who never aſſerted their Opinions like Arrogant Dogmatiſts, but only as Doubts, or as Anſwers which to them ſeem'd probable, in ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Queſtions which were to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:205900:104"/> them propos'd. So that <hi>Anaxago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>'s Fire, <hi>Thales</hi>'s Water, <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>'s Attomes, ſet forth by another whoſe name I have forgot, are only means to explain the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things which to them ſeem'd probable, being there ſupported by Chymical Experiences without aſſerting any thing Poſitive.</p>
            <p>Among their Authors of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology</hi> I found the <hi>Greek</hi> New Teſtament which I had preſented them. Of which I demanded the Reaſon from the Library Keeper: who anſwer'd me, That he had obſerv'd moſt excellent Precepts of Morality therein; but by reaſon of a Celeſtial Genealogy, and ſome other particulars, that did not ſeem rationably to be believ'd, he had rank'd it among thoſe Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, by advice of his Council compos'd of Four other Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, deputed as he was, by the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:205900:104"/> Thirty. Thereupon I took an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to unfold to them the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Chriſtian Religion, ſo univerſally believ'd by the Princes and Potentates of Europe; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever without making any progreſs among them, becauſe I had to do with People that acknowledg'd no other Authority but that of Sence and Reaſon, which cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Myſteries of Faith. But when I came to tell them of one Nature in three Perſons, of two Natures in one Perſon, and one inviſible incorporeal Deity, who was All in All, and All in every Part; born in a Stable, Crucify'd upon a Croſs, and reproducing himſelf every day in a thouſand Parts of the World to be ſwallow'd by his Adorers, they began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe among themſelves that I was frantick, and talk'd already of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me among the mad Folks, ſo
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:205900:105"/> that I was forc'd to change my Language.</p>
            <p>If there be ſuch a God, ſaid one to me, as you deſcribe, who would be Worſhipt by all the Earth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Religion which you propoſe, and that this Faith is the only way to gain Heaven, and ſhun everlaſting Torment, it had become his Wiſdom, his Goodneſs and his Omnipotency, to have caus'd it to have been divulg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad at firſt through all the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, after the cleareſt and moſt intelligible manner imaginable, to prevent the ruin of ſo many Men who have periſh'd according to your Principles, for theſe ſixteen Centuries paſt, becauſe they never heard of any ſuch thing. Inſtead of expoſing an Innocent Son to the ſeverity of Torment, he ſhould have ſent him into the World with an Equipage anſwerable to his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:205900:105"/> Birth, that he might have been heard with more reſpect; with an Army to render him formidable; and with Lightning in his hand to terrifie thoſe that would not obey his Law. Here I ſhew'd them the neceſſity of Chriſts Humility, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding to them the Myſtery of our Redemption; and giving them to underſtand that there was no other way for the Redeemer to expiate our Crimes, and fully to ſatisfie the Juſtice of the Father. Where is that Judge, reply'd my Antagoniſt, that would condemn an Innocent Son for the ſake of Criminals? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially it being in his ſole and only Power to ſave by a meer amniſty. Notwithſtanding all this, after I had laid before them all that the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and the beſt Divines of the Church had taught me, of moſt profound and moſt refin'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe Matters, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:205900:106"/> to put an end to my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, in regard thoſe Centlemen denying my Foundations, it was impoſſible for me to make any breach in their Belief.</p>
            <p>I remain'd a whole Month in this Sun-adoring Country, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the City, ſometimes in the Country, whither I kept ſome of the Citizens Company, who went to make merry with their Children. And indeed I could willingly have ended my days in this place, had not the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my Friends and my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in Europe oblig'd me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Which I did, after I had taken leave of the Senate, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that I ſhould be furniſh'd with a Waggon to the Borders of their Territories; and that the Archon of the laſt Country Farm ſhould in my behalf agree with a <hi>Tartar</hi> to conduct me to the <hi>Caſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:205900:106"/> Sea. I muſt confeſs I made a Propoſition to <hi>Eugenes</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to have taken a Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Europe;</hi> but they very frankly told me, That there was not any thing which I had related to them, concerning our Parts of the World that bred in them the leaſt Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to undergo ſo great a trouble. Upon that I preſented my Friend with an Emrald ſorrounded with Diamonds; and he preſented me with the Works of <hi>Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Thales</hi> the <hi>Mileſian,</hi> together with a certain Stone, which our Lapidaries know not what to make of. After that taking leave of my Friend upon the Frontiers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had accompany'd me, as well out of friendſhip, as by the Orders of the Thirty, in hopes to ſee each other again, I betook my ſelf to the Conduct of my <hi>Tartar,</hi> who taking a neerer but more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:205900:107"/> way than what I had travell'd before, gave me opportunity of ſeeing ſeveral Countries, not much unlike thoſe Beautiful and Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glooms that adorn the <hi>Alpes</hi> of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> of which I intend to give a Deſcription, if theſe my preſent Travels find a favourable reception.</p>
            <p>In ſix Weeks time I came to a Village by the Sea-ſide, where to comfort me for the loſs of <hi>Eugenes,</hi> I had the happineſs to meet with <hi>Monthreſor,</hi> who after the uſual Embraces, and Tender Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſuch an unexpected meeting could invent, gave me an accompt, how that after he had been carry'd away by the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity of the Current, he enter'd into a deep Water, ſalt and ſtill; which made him believe himſelf to be in the Sea, where he often lanch'd himſelf forth according to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:205900:107"/> the Art of ſwimming; that at firſt he found ſome reſiſtance at the top, which made him ſwim between the two Waters, darting himſelf forth withal the ſtrength he could, till at length he gain'd the Shore of the Sea that waſhes this Coaſt. I ask'd him what he ſaw remarkable under that ſame <hi>Tartarian Pauſillipus.</hi> To which he anſwer'd that by the thick darkneſs of that dreadful Cave, tho' it were at Noon day, he could make no Obſervation by his ſight, but that his Ears were ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd with a Horrid Whiſtling, of which he had no time to examin the Reaſon, in regard his Thoughts were all employ'd how to ſave himſelf. After that we made a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation one to another of our paſt Adventures, while we ſtaid to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark in a Fiſher-boat, like thoſe of <hi>Marteguois,</hi> and ſo ſwift that it brought us to <hi>Santa Maria</hi> in four
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:205900:108"/> days, from whence we held the ſame Courſe backward as we had done forward.</p>
            <p>Returning through <hi>Athens</hi> I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited my Hoſt <hi>Epiphanes,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd me with a great deal of joy, returning me a thouſand thanks for the good Effects of my <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagricon,</hi> finding himſelf abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed from the Tormenting pains of the Gout by the uſe of it. And I ſhould have been much more glad to find my ſelf ſo Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the Recovery of a Perſon from whom I had receiv'd ſo much kindneſs, had not my Joy been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by the news which I receiv'd at the ſame time of the death of <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Athens</hi> I had a deſign to have taken a Journey to <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> but underſtanding I ſhould ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Mountain, like to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hills, with out any Footſteps
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:205900:108"/> of Antiquity, I laid aſide thoſe thoughts. For I am not of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of many Men that put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a great deal of trouble, meerly that they may be able to ſay they have been at ſuch or ſuch a place when mention'd in Company. If the Beauties of a Country do not draw me thither, there muſt be at leaſt ſome remainder of thoſe that formerly inhabited thoſe Parts, whence I may in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure underſtand the Faſhions of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and Cuſtoms of a People whom Hiſtory has repreſented to the World with Applauſe; nor is the knowledge of the Manners and Cuſtoms of the preſent Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, able to make a Parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and their anceſtors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a Man of Wit; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore above all things I flye to a place where once Learning flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd. If a Traveller does not propoſe to himſelf theſe Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:205900:109"/> he will find himſelf often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, in regard he will not ſee the fourth part of what he expects, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reading of Relations, no leſs flattering and deceitful than Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that generally repreſent Faces much fairer then they are; unleſs it be that a Man is deſirous to know of himſelf the Situation of Places, which I have found to be very much miſtaken in the beſt Maps.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Athens</hi> we return'd to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> whoſe delicious Climate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd <hi>Monthreſor</hi> to ſtop there. For my own part I return'd into <hi>France,</hi> where after I had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented all the Rigours of a Cruel Fortune, in the year 1676, I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd at <hi>Rochel</hi> in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, which brought me to <hi>Plymouth</hi> the 28th. of <hi>September,</hi> having a deſire to terminate my Travels and my days in this Kingdom. But the Enemy of my repoſe would ſuffer me to take no reſt, having
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:205900:109"/> found out new neceſſities for me to reviſit as well <hi>France,</hi> as ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> through Roads not common, where I have made ſeveral Remarks, which I ſhall communicate to Publick view, when I underſtand what kind of entertainment this my firſt Volume has receiv'd: For nature not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly ſhut up in one ſmall Corner, it behoves a Philoſopher to ſound for Experience in various Parts, which he cannot otherwiſe do than by Travelling; elſe the Company of Learned Men and rare Wits, which are in Kingdoms and Countries like ſo many <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nixes,</hi> is not to be acquir'd, but by a ſtrict ſurvey of thoſe Kingdoms. And indeed by the means of theſe two aſſiſtances it was, that I found what I ſought for in the Study of Philoſophy, which of all the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies I have labour'd in, even to the maintaining of General Theſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:205900:110"/> all that could be known, is that which I have taken moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in all my Life time for theſe thirty years together, that I have apply'd my ſelf ſolely to it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all the reſt, excepting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Phyſick, which following like her Daughter ſo cloſe at the heels, no leſs deſerv'd my Courtſhip. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the exact knowledge of the Body of Man, which ſhe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes her followers, making me hope that ſhe would favour my deſigns of diving into the Secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, bred in me a ſtrong Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that time forward to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf devoutly to that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And the Progreſs which I made both in the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeem'd ſufficient to my Friends to importune me to take the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Doctor in both Faculties. Wherein I prov'd ſucceſsful with all the Honour that an Honeſt Man could wiſh for, during a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:205900:110"/> that I ſojourn'd at <hi>Padua,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had undergone the utmoſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours of a ſtrict Examination both in Publick and Private. Nor was it leſs than I deſir'd; tho' being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of my Birth, they would have treated me more Nobly, that is to ſay, they would have paſs'd me without Examination. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver though I hold my ſelf highly honour'd with theſe two Degrees, yet I do not pretend to value my ſelf upon that of Phyſick; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too mean and proſtituted to the moſt ignorant in the <hi>Eſculapian</hi> School, who arrive to be no more than bare Mountebanks; beſides that the Faculty is extreamly decry'd by the Diſhonour done it by idle and ſilly Practitioners. Neither do I practiſe it my ſelf, as well to avoid the Reproaches to which a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian is expos'd if he fail of ſucceſs which often befals him, as for that my Conſtitution will not brook
